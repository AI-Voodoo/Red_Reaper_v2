As you know, Japanese electricity trading is on the way of deregulation beneficial to the consumers from a long stage of the nine major companies' regional monopoly.

I and my colleague Yamada, who will attend Risk Publications Monte Calro seminar in Four Seasons Hotel, would like to visit you and your company for studying the sophisticated risk management at Enron. In return, we may give you the information about recent institutional progress and major electricity companies response in Japan.

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",

The TW reps agreed that the best method to accomplish the Blanco interconnect would be for TW to tap its existing 30 inch (formerly NWPL Ignacio-Blanco) pipeline that is running N-S approx 120 lf east of the proposed S Trails Blanco Meter site. To accomplish the tie in would then require about 120 lf of 20 inch (or perhaps 12 inch) pipeline, parallel to the right of way corridor that Questar has already acquired from TW for the extension to WFS Milagro. The custody transfer meter facilities and any control facilities would then be installed on the Questar site. TW stated that pressure ranges between 928 to 950 psig in this 30 inch pipeline. Agreement needs to be finalized on who installs the tap, pipeline tie in, and meter facilities. It would be good if TW would agree that Questar could accomplish all work, with the exception of the tap of the 30 inch pipeline.

        "content": " jdasovic.nsf GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION'S REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis' remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) report: \"My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable. That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in. I believe we are making a good start. \"Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego, and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources, like the photovotaic program you see behind us, to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce California's use of electricity by 10% when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries, including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day. \"Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional. It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work. And I repeat again, deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive, which it is not. \"I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today. It is a mixed blessing. They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable. However, they did not, as I encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through. \"FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent service operator, and the power exchange. FERC agrees with me that they are self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation. However, it is unclear what will replace those boards. The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust. The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California. \"I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology. I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees. I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us.' So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about 12 months ago. That has got to stop. Question inaudible. \"It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with. Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I. There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established. So it is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange. My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not. That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days. Question inaudible. \"We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take. I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is. But we are making progress. Question inaudible. \"That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation. At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared. The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is not competitive. There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state. I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this ill-conceived scheme. \"I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable. I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions. It looks like we are going to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment, critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part. This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before. \"I believe refunds are due and necessary. FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds. It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not. Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that. Over the long haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly. As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state. The people of California will stand up; they will rise up and take matters into their own hands. The problem with deregulation lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon. Question inaudible. \"Let me just say two things. I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year. You cannot add value to an electron. An electron is an electron. They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear. I am standing up and saying no more. We are not going to take this lying down. We are fighting back. The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have. The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill. Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well maybe not so happy, to acknowledge. It may have seemed like a good idea in 1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on whether it was a good idea then. But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a good idea. Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them. FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted. There is no question about that. They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests. Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards. You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state. So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards. Question inaudible. \"You are more right than wrong. As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses. Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy. Without water and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck. Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a question not worth debating today. But it does not make sense today. Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in 1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise. So it is unclear how much power is left to the state. FERC seems to be suggesting today, not much. Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep. \"I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable. What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result. Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare. Without electricity there is no economic growth, without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations.

        "content": "Articles on Yesterday's hearings from Seattle Papers State wins OK to inspect pipelines by Brier Dudley Seattle Times staff reporter [IMAGE] BELLINGHAM - Federal regulators yesterday agreed to allow Washington state to inspect all interstate pipelines within its borders, as requested by Gov. Gary Locke and the state Legislature. \"We've got it - we've just got to work out the fine details,\" Locke said. State officials think they'll do a better job inspecting the 2,500 miles of pipelines in the state than the federal Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), an agency that's been harshly criticized since Olympic Pipe Line's June 10 explosion in Bellingham that killed three people. Other states have tried unsuccessfully to take control of pipeline inspections from the OPS, which has only 13 inspectors for the West Coast, but only four states now have that authority. Still unresolved, however, is whether the state will be allowed to impose safety standards stricter than federal standards. The state's authority could also be short-lived if the OPS and the oil industry persuade Congress later this year to reduce states' role in pipeline oversight. Mixed messages about the safety office's position were delivered yesterday at a special Senate field hearing on pipeline-safety concerns. Locke announced that the state was given testing authority, based on a faxed letter he received just hours earlier from the top administrator for pipeline safety. The fax said the state could take over inspections on condition that only one state agency were responsible. A state law approved last week would have divided the task between two. But later in the hearing, OPS' deputy administrator, Richard Felder, acknowledged under questioning that he would prefer that inspection authority remain with his office. To sidestep that debate, U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., proposed amending the federal law that gives the OPS authority over pipelines that cross state lines. Because Olympic Pipe Line is almost entirely in Washington - its 400-mile system parallels Interstate 5 and ends in Portland - Gorton suggested that states be allowed to regulate pipelines that are over 90 percent within their borders. Olympic, a Renton-based subsidiary of Shell, Texaco, Arco and oil shipper GATX, testified that it would prefer federal oversight. \"Having a unified set of regulations is important for a smooth operation,\" said manager Carl Gast. Gorton and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., hosts of the hearing, both want the state to have more authority over interstate pipelines. They're backing legislation that would give states authority and funding to inspect pipelines themselves and require better collection and sharing of data about pipelines' condition. They also want the stricter standards on pipeline testing, monitoring and operations. Murray, whose twin sister teaches at a Bellingham school near the explosion site, noted that pipelines have spilled 5,700 times and killed 325 people in the U.S. since 1986. She also said they leak 6 million gallons of hazardous material a year, or the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill every two years. During the hearing at Bellingham City Hall, the senators also heard emotional pleas for stricter regulations from victims' parents. Two 10-year-old boys and an 18-year-old fisherman died after Olympic spilled 277,000 gallons of gasoline into a city park. \"There needs to be a zero-spill policy, not `we only kill two or three kids a year,' \" said Frank King, whose 10-year-old, Wade, died in the explosion. Katherine Dalen, mother of 10-year-old victim Stephen Tsorvias, said the accident made people realize their neighborhoods may not be safe because of the poorly regulated underground pipelines. Also testifying were city officials from Renton, SeaTac and Bellevue. Like Bellingham, those cities are trying to get Olympic to provide more information and testing to assure residents that the pipeline is safe. Olympic's Gast noted that the company will use two devices to internally inspect its entire pipeline later this year. The cause of the accident is still being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board, which has been hampered by Olympic employees' refusal to testify and by a federal criminal investigation into the accident. Copyright , 2000 The Seattle Times Company Pipeline blast still evokes anger Grieving parents urge senators to pass tough safety bill Tuesday, March 14, 2000 By SCOTT SUNDE Mail Author SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER BELLINGHAM -- Nine months have passed since Bruce Brabec's stepson died in a horrific pipeline accident here. But the memories haven't faded. Photo ? Mary King weeps as her husband, Frank, testifies yesterday at a Senate field hearing in Bellingham on pipeline safety. Their son, Wade, died in the June pipeline explosion. Dan DeLong/P-I ? The smell of gasoline when Brabec fills the family car reminds him of the fumes that killed Liam Wood, who was 18 and out for a day of flyfishing on June 10. The sound of the newspaper hitting the front porch every morning reminds Brabec of when police arrived to tell him and his wife that Liam had been overcome by fumes from leaking gasoline and drowned. \"Imagine going home tonight, and your child isn't home -- and never will be,\" Brabec told U.S. Sens. Slade Gorton and Patty Murray during a Senate field hearing on pipeline safety yesterday. ? Getting involved The public may mail written comments on improving pipeline safety to the Senate Commerce Committee, 508 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20510. Anger and anguish mixed freely at the hearing, which Gorton, a Republican, hopes will bolster efforts to win approval for a tough pipeline safety bill introduced by Democrat Murray. The hearing in Bellingham's Depression-era City Hall attracted an overflow crowd. Townsfolk were forced to huddle around television sets and watch the proceedings in the lobby. Their frequent applause at the angry words drifted up the stairs and into the crowded hearing room. State and local officials blasted the federal Office of Pipeline Safety as ineffective. It regulates interstate pipelines such as the one owned by Olympic Pipe Line Co. that ruptured and caught fire in Bellingham last June. There was anger, too, at Olympic. Officials from cities through which the pipeline runs said the company had resisted supplying them with data from pipe inspections, then agreed by providing \"X's and O's\" that no one could understand. \"We have no confidence,\" said Connie Marshall, Bellevue's deputy mayor, \"that the Olympic pipeline is safely maintained and operated within our city.\" The company, however, pledged a safer pipeline, pointing to a plan instituted in October to add valves, test pressure, strengthen computer processing and make sophisticated internal inspections. The company is trying to improve any system that may have been at fault in the June 10 accident, said Carl Gast, Olympic vice president and manager. \"We are not waiting until after the investigation (by the National Transportation Safety Board) is complete to take action,\" Gast said. Gast, who has worked in the pipeline industry for 31 years, called the company's safety plan \"the most far-reaching with which I've ever been involved.\" Olympic runs a 400-mile system that takes petroleum products from refineries north of Bellingham and at Anacortes to Portland. The system runs near the Interstate 5 corridor, including through the suburbs east of Lake Washington. The victims: Wade King: The 10-year-old burned to death while playing in Whatcom Creek when it erupted in a fireball June 10. Stephen Tsorvias: Also, 10, he was playing with Wade when gasoline ignited after spilling from a ruptured Olympic Pipe Line fuel line. Liam Wood: The 18-year-old was flyfishing on the creek when he was overcome by leaking gasoline fumes and drowned. The anguish at the hearing came from the parents of Wood and parents of two 10-year-old boys -- Wade King and Stephen Tsorvias -- who burned to death as 277,000 gallons of spilled gasoline ignited and a fireball roared down Whatcom Creek. At times, \"sadness tears our hearts apart and drowns our spirits,\" said Katherine Dalen, Stephen's mother. Marlene Robinson, Liam's mother, said softly: \"I no longer have children to protect.\" They, too, were angry at Olympic and at the Office of Pipeline Safety. The boys' families have filed wrongful-death lawsuits against Olympic. Frank King, Wade's father, made it clear yesterday whom he blames for the tragedy. \"The company is an outrage. It needs to be shut down,\" King said. \"Olympic's gross, wanton recklessness killed my little man.\" King said he has evidence that Olympic had a chance in July 1997 to dig up the pipe where it would later rupture to check for possible problems, but decided not to because the excavation would be too difficult. Bellingham has a water plant near the site of the rupture and numerous water pipes are above the pipeline. In an interview, King produced an Olympic document gathered for his lawsuit that he said indicated that the company decided not to dig up the pipe. In 1996 and 1997, Olympic did an internal inspection of its pipeline. Possible defects were identified in the inspections near where the pipe would later rupture. But Olympic has said the possible defects did not seem serious enough to dig up the pipeline near the water plant. Olympic Pipe Line spokeswoman Maggie Brown said King's testimony marked the first time she had ever heard the claim that the company was prepared to dig up that section of pipe in 1997 but decided not to. King's wife, Mary, erupted in frustration that the accident was allowed to happen. \"If this is properly maintained, regulated, whatever, it won't happen again,\" she said tearfully. \"Anything is going to be better than what went on in the past, which was nothing.\" In fact, pipeline regulation may be changing. The Washington Legislature passed a bill this year that sets up a state pipeline safety program and asks the federal government for the power to police interstate lines like Olympic's. Gov. Gary Locke told Gorton and Murray yesterday that the federal government may be willing to give the state the authority to inspect interstate pipelines. Four states currently have that authority, but the federal government still retains the right to punish pipeline companies over problems found in inspections. A top official of the U.S. Transportation Department told Locke in a letter yesterday that the federal government may give Washington inspection authority. Locke, however, also wants the state to have the authority to regulate pipelines and to use tougher standards than the federal rules to do so. Murray's bill would give the states more authority. Richard Felder, head of the Office of Pipeline Safety, admitted that his regulators have had problems. \"We worked to restore public confidence,\" Felder said, \"but clearly we have a long way to go.\" Felder said the office's proposed budget would provide it with more money for regulation. He also said his office will propose a new regulation by the end of the month to require companies to test the safety of their pipelines. Gorton and Murray, however, seemed unconvinced that federal regulators will get tough. So was Bob Chipkovitch, who runs the pipeline program at the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB, which has no regulatory authority, has repeatedly recommended tougher rules, only to see nothing happen in the Office of Pipeline Safety, he said. For example, 12 years after the NTSB recommended that regulators require periodic inspections, no such rule has been adopted. \"I hope Bellingham has made a difference,\" Chipkovitch said. \"No, we haven't seen a change yet (by regulators). But I hope this accident does provide the impetus to do that.\" The NTSB has yet to determine the cause of the June 10 accident. But Chipkovitch said the investigation so far has shown \"significant performance failures\" by pipeline controllers. He noted that the pipeline rupture began at 3:30 p.m. June 10 after a pump failure near Woodinville, computer problems at the company's Renton headquarters and a valve closed near Anacortes. But 45 minutes later, refineries north of Bellingham resumed putting gasoline in the line. Controllers only started shutting down the pipeline for good at 4:30. At the point where the pipeline ruptured, there may be evidence of external damage, Chipkovitch said. Olympic contends that construction at the water plant in 1994 damaged the pipe. But investigators have yet to fully test the damaged pipe. A federal criminal investigation into the accident has kept them from doing so. At the same time, several Olympic officials have refused to talk to the NTSB, fearing they would incriminate themselves. Chipkovitch said the investigation also focuses on the valve near Anacortes that closed June 10, increasing pressure in the pipe upstream. The valve closed 50 times in the six months before the Bellingham accident, he said. Pipeline accidents Some of the country's largest pipeline accidents in recent years: June 10, 1999: The Olympic Pipe Line Co.'s pipeline in Bellingham ruptured and 277,000 gallons of jet fuel spilled into Whatcom Creek, then ignited (above), killing two 10-year-old boys and an 18-year-old fisherman. It was the 43rd reported spill on the line since it was opened in 1965. November 1996: Propane from a leaking gas-service pipe exploded in downtown San Juan, Puerto Rico, killing 33 people and injuring 69 others. August 1996: A pipeline carrying liquid butane ruptured in Lively, Texas, sending a butane vapor cloud into a residential area. Two residents tried to escape, but their vehicle's ignition started a fire that killed them. June 1996: A fuel oil line ruptured near Fork Shoals, S.C., spilling 958,000 gallons into the Reedy River. May 1996: A gasoline pipeline near Gramercy, La., ruptured and spilled 475,000 gallons of fuel into wetlands and a river. February 1994: A natural-gas pipeline exploded in Edison, N.J., destroying three apartment buildings and leaving 1,500 people homeless. August 1989: Soil tests result in the discovery of a decades-long spill in an Avila Beach, Calif., pipeline which Union Oil Co. had used for almost 90 years. The entire commercial center of the town was razed in the cleanup effort, which is continuing (left). Another pipeline nearby was found to have leaked more than 9 million gallons of crude oil over a 50-year period. Unocal has agreed to pay more than $48 million in cleanup costs. May 1989: A gasoline pipeline ruptured in San Bernardino, Calif., killing two people and destroying 11 homes. December 1980: A corroded line carrying naphtha ruptured in Long Beach, Calif. The flammable substance sprayed 20 feet into the air, then ignited, injuring 5 and destroying or damaging 12 homes. ?

        "content": " KWATSON (Non-Privileged).pst Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, \"We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.\" Regent President John Ehrman said, \"The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.\" The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

A question arose regarding the many operations of our breaker in the pad mounted transformer that took place December through March. Gary's thought is that when we recalculate the availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to Exhibit GG in the TSIA, LOH is defined in short as any time the grid does not meet \"(i) the specifications required by the WTG as set forth in the Technical Specifications\", and Gary agrees with this. The problem is that an engineering change on the breaker settings was implemented some time in March to reduce the number of breaker operations on site. We are still seeing many grid faults in the turbine but not in the PMT breaker. The question that Gary brought up is were the original settings of the breaker set to the WTG Technical Specifications and operating due to the on going grid conditions OR were the settings improper to start with causing the breaker to operate while the grid was within Technical Specifications.",

Have you heard any more back from the principals yet, or are you not going to know anything until tomorrow? I know tonight is study night for her spelling test, so I probably won't talk to you tonight. Rev. Jackson called me yesterday. I thought that was funny, he said they had told him that I was upset about my contribution statement, and he thought he would give me a call to apologize and see if he could do anything. He then went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings, because I was a generous contributor. I then proceeded to give him a piece of my mind, because they need to get serious about the business end of the church. By the way, I was talking to Kent the other day, and he mentioned that Carolyn Jenkins was no longer at the church. That's interesting. I can only imagine what happened there! Anyway, do you have your African attire yet? I have some, but it's old, and I had been thinking about buying something new. I might go to Sharpstown and have a look, but that is not set in stone. It depends on what type of time I have and what type of mood I'm in. You know we're supposed to wear our African attire on Sunday. You know we have an outing to First Metropolitan Church on Sunday at 3:00 p.m. I'm pretty sure I won't be attending. I'm tired of going to the same places. We need some variety. Gregg needs to get some new \"hook-ups\" if he wants people to keep supporting them on the outings. And another thing, I am so sick of singing the same songs. If we have to sing \"In the Sanctuary\" one more time, I'm going to throw up. I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% off. It said you could only print the coupon once, but I printed it several times, and it kept printing, so remind me to give you a coupon. See you later!!!!!",

        "content": " mark fischer 7-12-02 LNotes.nsf Ward, As per your request, attached is the wind data, and curtailment information from Clear Sky for the month of January. Please note that due to a lack of 10 min. data from SCADA, the turbine data for the month of January is not available. We are confident that this situation will not be repeated. It is also important to note that periods of curtailment were derived from the manual log provided by the site. There were 13 periods between 1/22/2002 and 1/31/2002. Since turbine nacelle wind speeds were not available, 4 met stations were selected (0648, 0651,0652,0659). The met station data is recorded hourly. The wind speeds were extrapolated to hub height using shear estimates. The hub height wind speeds were converted to kWh by applying the Clear Sky Power curve. For each curtailment period the kWh values were summed to give an estimate from each met tower, the four estimates were averaged, the averages were then multiplied by the number of curtailed turbines. This generated a estimate for each curtailment period. These values were then multiplied by .97*.98 (97% availability and 2% line loss) as spelled out in section 2.(b) of the PPA, to get a net loss. For January 2002 the sum of these estimates was 1,770,692 kWh. If there are additional requirements you may contact me at (661) 823-6886 or direct Rich Simon to contact Mark Fisher of our Data Analysis group at (661) 823-6545. ",

        "content": " gwhalley.nsf The votes have been counted. We won. Thank you for your support. The 2000 election should be over. But because the Democrats are trying to rewrite the rules, the fight continues. Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney urgently need your help. To contribute immediately, see form below. The situation in Florida is unprecedented and the dispute may still spread to other closely contested states. We are confident of victory, but we need your help. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney clearly won the majority of legitimately cast ballots in Florida and, with Florida's 25 electors, a majority of the Electoral College. All the Democrat maneuvering -- in the courts, in the streets, on television -- is designed to confuse the public about that simple fact while throwing the election into a rigged process in which partisan Democrat officials can count thousands of improper ballots. We MUST NOT let the Democrats steal this election. The RNC has sent staff to Florida and other battleground states such as Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon and Wisconsin as well. We are fighting a multi-front war, and it is expensive. These costs are unexpected and unbudgeted -- and they come at a time when the RNC's resources have been depleted by the election. That's why I'm asking for your help again today. I've included two articles - Charles Krauthammer's November 17 column, and excerpts from a Los Angeles Times report -- that describe how the Democrats are waging this battle. I hope you'll take time to read them -- they are revealing, and they emphasize how high the stakes are in this contest. Again, I would ask you to read the articles below - and then do four important things for our country: 1) send this e-mail on to your own e-mail list - to all of your friends and neighbors who care about this country and want the truth to come out in Florida 2) Call, e-mail and write your local elected officials, Democrats and Republicans. You can get the addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of your elected Congress people and Senators at http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/ 3) call your local talk radio show or TV news show and let them know your strong views on this issue 4) write a letter to the editor of your local, regional or national newspapers on this important subject Al Gore lost on November 7. He is now seeking to reverse the results of the election in court. This is an outrage -- and it is a sad day for our country. We will fight this battle with all the available means at our disposal. Please help as generously as you can. See below how to contribute online, or send your contribution to: Republican National Committee 310 First Street S.E. Washington, D.C. 20003 Thank you. Sincerely, Jim Nicholson Chairman Republican National Committee Washington Post Friday , November 17, 2000 ; Page A45 Not by Hand By Charles Krauthammer There is a reason that machines have been chosen by Florida and so many other states to count ballots. The reason is not only speed and efficiency but fairness. Of course machines make mistakes, but the mistakes are distributed randomly. There is no premeditation, no search for advantage. Undoubtedly there were many presidential ballots that were double-punched, under-punched or otherwise spoiled in Florida. But machines read such errors with scrupulous impartiality. The same cannot be said of hand counting. Hand counting is arbitrary, open to manipulation and abuse. Mechanical ballots are designed to be read by machines, not humans. When humans try, the results, as we have seen in Palm Beach, range from the arbitrary to the bizarre. Hence the comic contortions of the ballot examiners holding up cards to the light, trying to divine the intent of voters. Hence the spectacle of Gore supporters going to court to get a judge to declare that \"dimpled chads\"--a slight indentation in the piece of paper one is supposed to punch through, even slighter than the now legendary \"pregnant chad\"--must be counted as a vote. Second, a manual recount subjects computer cards, literally, to manipulation. Under this method, the presidency of the United States hangs by a thread, the thread holding the dangling chad. Any waving, shuffling, rubbing or other movement can easily cut the thread, dislodge the chad, and produce a \"vote.\" This would be true even if those judging the ballots were perfectly neutral. They are not. The counting by hand is in fact counting by Democrats: The counties now seeking to conduct these recounts--Palm Beach and Broward--are controlled by Democrats. The decision regarding the legality of every newfound Gore vote is made by a committee that is either entirely or majority Democratic. These counties, moreover, are two of the most heavily Democratic in the state. They went for Gore with majorities larger than that by which Lyndon Johnson won over Barry Goldwater in 1964--and that was the biggest landslide of our time. Broward Democrats chose three sample precincts to decide whether to recount the entire county: Two of the test districts voted 20 to 1 for Gore, the third 50 to 1. Brezhnev never did that well. In such heavily Democratic districts, there is no way a recount will not produce more net votes for Gore. You simply expand or narrow your criteria for voter \"intent\"--and produce whatever number you need to win. What is the fairest way to determine the winner in a state such as Florida? The fairest is a statewide machine count--and recount. Why? Because the errors balance out. What about a statewide manual recount, an option offered by Gore in his televised Nov. 15 gambit? It has two disabling liabilities. First, it vastly multiplies the opportunity for fraud and bias. Thousands of people in thousands of precincts handling millions of cards--cards that can be manipulated and altered with ridiculous ease. There just aren't enough watchdogs to watch all the partisans. See the full article at http://www.washingtonpost.com/ SEASONED DEMOCRATIC ARMY HITS THE SHORES OF FLORIDA Excerpts from The Los Angeles Times: \"To scrounge for every last vote, Gore has flooded Fort Lauderdale with tough, seasoned Democrats, the sort who are used to keeping wafflers in line and to count and recount votes until they know exactly what it will take to outdo their opponents. Many of the hired hands speak with a Boston brogue... \"Not far away, in an abandoned Payless shoe store, vanloads of AFL-CIO staffers and Gore loyalists from New York, Chicago, Nashville, Philadelphia, San Francisco and elsewhere had disembarked to learn how to observe the ballot count. \"'Our goal,' said one lawyer as he patiently lectured his new charges, 'is to preserve the Al Gore vote.' The volunteers nodded. 'It's very, very important that if you see any kind of mark--a scratch, a dent, a pinprick in Al Gore's column--that you challenge.' When someone then asked what they should do if they found a Bush ballot with an indent, the lawyer said: 'Keep your lips sealed.' It was hardball that the Bostonians and other importe! d pros understood well.\" Full Article: http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/decision2000/lat_dems001117.htm Dear Jim, Yes, I'll help!

Biblically, life means to unite and death means to separate. When Adam became a living being, his soul was in union with his body. When he died, his soul separated from his body. As long as you are alive, your soul is united with your body. But when that separation occurs, you do not cease to exist. Paul said that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:8). Your primary identity is not found in your physical existence. Paul said, \"From now on we recognize no man according to the flesh\" (2 Corinthians 5:16). Even though your principal identity is more than physical, in this temporal life you cannot function without your physical body. Your immaterial self needs your material self, and vice versa. You need your physical brain to control your movements and responses, and you need your immaterial mind to reason and make value judgments. Your brain is like a computer and your mind is the programmer. The finest human brain can't accomplish anything in a corpse which lacks a mind. And the most brilliant mind cannot function in a brain damaged by Alzheimer's disease. In 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 Paul referred to the believer's body as a tent, the temporary dwelling place of the soul. Using his illustration, I must confess that my tent pegs are coming up, my poles are sagging, and my seams are becoming frayed! At my age I'm just glad that there's more to me than the disposable earth suit I walk around in. You don't exist for your body; it exists for you. That's why Paul said, \"I beat my body and make it my slave\" (1 Corinthians 9:27 NIV). In order to fulfill your purpose for being here, you need to manage your body well through exercise, balanced diet and adequate rest. Lord, help me to not overemphasize or underemphasize the significance of my physical life but stay in step with Your view. ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.
