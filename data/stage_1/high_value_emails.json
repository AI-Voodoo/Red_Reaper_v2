After transaction closing, payments for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account. Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing. If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a hard copy expense report form which will be available at www.enron.com.

        "clean_content": "Organizational Changes To: Enron North America Corp. From: Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets, and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce the following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA. 1) Coverage/Origination: To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service companies and IPP's; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries. Downstream Coverage/Origination As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear that the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp. Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp. Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENA's existing energy commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also EES's energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel's chemicals, plastics and refined products risk management capability. These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg's leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering: a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision of paper risk management products; b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries; c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers Trust's global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to leadthe coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing industries. Midstream Coverage/Origination a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group' activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect. We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of this group; b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. They will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring opportunities in the Western U.S. We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination efforts; c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio's of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group. In addition, Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect; d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructuring opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets. We have asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair, formerly of Enron Asia's development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join this newly formed business. 2) Commercial Transactions: The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA's efficiency in executing transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage. CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management. The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership, execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups. This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions: a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western Coverage/Origination Groups. The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy Lemmons joined Enron in 1992. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA's industrial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining, Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established. The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich. We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups. The senior members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud and John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix. We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups. The senior members of this team include Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert. We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend. Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams. Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group. The remaining four groups within CTG will remain largely unchanged. In addition, the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together. We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ENA's markets particularly in the industrial markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups. Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in North America by working with us to implement these changes. ",

The trades should continue to be initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling. These same procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions. Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company. The Termination Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature. The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be terminated. Reverse trades should not be entered into. If you have any questions, please call. ",

I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and replace of business days for Business Days. 1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of performance test reports. I think we need a definition that incorporates the tests listed on Exhibit E. The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of the installation option when I did a search. 3.14.2.1 Is 6 months enough under this circumstances? Does it matter? 4.3 Delete \"Each\". 5.1 The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm interpretting it incorrectly. 5.3 (ii) add \"as provided in Section 5.5\" 6.4 I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller would be charged interest if not timely paid. 10.7 Are the roman numerals correct?. I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back option. You should have it today. Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read before?

Transmission Reduction on the participation on OMEL and REE to 10% Distribution Market share of 48% of distribution: As above, we do not know yet how this is expressed, but Vicent was suggesting last Tuesday that a \"meaningful\" criteria was going to be applied, as opposed to the \"meaningless and biased\" suggested by the utilities and the CNE. We recommended 40% as compared to 66% proposed by the utilities. Commercialisation Market share of 40% of new + renew contracts on the whole Spanish territory. On the top of this, the merged company's market share cannot go beyond 60% of new + renewed contracts on its own distribution area. Although our proposal of applying these same limits to existing and new contracts has not gone through (there were actually legal problems involved on that), we could claim a great deal of \"responsibility\" on implementing the second boundary relative to their own distribution area. (We actually had to convinced Sempra and Aquila to support this initiative). Although we do not know yet how the % is expressed (as above), it is very important the second limitation on their own distribution territory, in order to spur retail competition and tackle distcos' discriminatory behaviour on access and metering issues. Recall that by 2003 all customers are eligible, and this limitation will last until 2005. CTCs CTCs rights are passed to new owners, but the capital gains associated to divestiture to offset CTCs rights of the seller. We battled for this last piece, but not for the transferral of CTC rights to new owners. We will need to analysed this more carefully in the decree itself. No more securitisation! The 4.5% of the tariff, which was devoted to fund CTCs has been eliminated. Therefore, we come back to the early days mechanism. Implications: 1) the CTC mechanism will be more transparent now, but still opaque overall; 2) Will the 1998 CTC write-off be re-established, that is, will CTCs increase?

The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of each of the Facility Agreements should be amended to read as follows: \"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the \"Refund Amount\") shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4 below.\" This is the same comment I made earlier. 2. Exhibits B-1 and H-2 are blank and the corresponding exhibits from the master GE sales agreement should be attached to the Facility Agreement. 3. The cross-reference to Exhibit N-1 should be deleted from Exhibit I as Exhibit N-1 was deleted from the Facility Agreement. 4. Exhibit R is blank, however, it is unclear whether this Exhibit is still relevant. 5. Exhibit U appears to be incomplete and the reference back to Section 10.8.4 is unclear.

One transaction was with Coral Energy Holding L.P. and three transactions were with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. As mutually agreed to by both the Enron commercial team and the respective counterparties, it was decided that each of the four transactions would not be confirmed and should be terminated. The exact specifics are detailed as follows: ? The transactions occurred due to an inadvertent entry in the actual production system of EnronOnline by a Product Control Group member, Melba Lozano. Melba activated a product assuming that she was in the EnronOnline test system of EnronOnline. ? The product transacted upon is normally managed by Frank Ermis. However, in his absence on Friday, the product was managed by Matt Lenhart. ? Steve South, trader on the West Desk, called and notified both Morgan and Coral that the product had been posted in error. All parties agreed that the transactions were not reflective of the normal pricing. As a result they further agreed that transaction confirmations would not be necessary and that the deals would be \"killed\" on all sides. (For reference of any telephone tapes that may need to be pulled, the conversations with the counterparties occurred around 2:00 pm.) ? No confirmations were generated as a result of the killing of the transactions in TAGG. ? I spoke with Mike Grigsby on Monday (April 23, 2001) and advised him that termination letters may be required by Legal. He responded that he had no problem with that. Tana, please advise if additional information is required to complete the termination letters or if another course of action is warranted. Thank you, Rob Cass x35491 ",

We tried to come up with as many arguments as possible, recognizing the strong commercial desire to put in the second interconnect. As we have discussed, certain language in the Interconnect Agreement is troublesome, generally due to the fact that it does not appear that a second interconnect was contemplated at the time the project was initially developed. Nonetheless, we believe that Caledonia does have a number of arguments in favor of the position that it should be able to build the second interconnect without a contractual block. The strength of some of these arguments will turn in large part on further factual development with the commercial group, as noted in a number of places in the memo. Please let me know when you wish to follow up. And, as I noted in my conversation with Elizabeth this morning, there is a possibility I may be in Houston next week and perhaps we could meet with the commercial folks at that time. I think it would be advisable to walk through the various possible scenarios/strategies with them so that we have the benefit of the TVA \"history\" and likely responses of TVA to some of the arguments noted in the memo.

        "clean_content": " TKUYKEN (Non-Privileged).pst This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals. The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done. These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is \"significant potential for undue discrimination\" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative. Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny. FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the \"linchpin\" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates. During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was \"important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side,\" that \"all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines.\" Last week's proclamation should be considered \"a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend,\" he asserted. In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties \"are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk\" of such unequal treatment. FERC declared that a \"key factor\" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an \"appropriate material deviation\" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide \"adequate alternatives\" to other shippers. In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs. The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, \"we have reconsidered that holding\" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order. Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an \"adequate alternative,\" the commission observed. \"However, if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not include any such provision.\" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk, giving it \"an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,\" the commission pointed out. \"A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,\" FERC said, adding that \"such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.\" Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights \"is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated\" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language \"will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.\" Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become \"muddled.\" Through a \"tortured line of cases,\" FERC's definitions of allowable contracting practices were \"obscured,\" Breathitt said in welcoming the new \"common-sense\" approach. The \"tug of war\" that parties have engaged in over the past few years \"really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service\" are available to all shippers, she said.",

I believe that PSEG is getting nervous that we may close on the Kendall LLC with another Buyer before they get their act together. Call me to discuss the timing of drafting such an LOI.

        "clean_content": " jdasovic.nsf Talked to Dave. In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he sees it. It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key points: Based on an expectation that the \"expedited siting\" bill would help site plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board. The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm requirement. The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or 2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting). In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO (which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of going to the market, thus killing the economics. On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that \"...it be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and maintain the plant,\" it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is (i.e, before the project has been approved), and, it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks prefer). In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific. Point 2 in bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public. If any questions, let me know. Bruno has emailed the price cap and the \"general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap\" bills, and faxed the siting bill. Best, Jeff",

Currently we do it one of two ways: 1) Straight revision to original EOL Deal number, or 2) Input reversal trade, also input new trade with correct deal terms (confirms on all three). Obviously the 1st option above is the easier way to go for us. However for EOL auditing, option 2 is cleaner. Also, if you think we should always go with the 2nd option above, should we be linking the deals together with some sort of verbage? Thanks, Joe Hunter ",

It largely tracks our understanding and analysis. The following are her words: \"To my knowledge, no one has challenged anything filed with the Commission under seal pursuant to the trade secret statute. Under that statute, if you want the information claimed to be a trade secret, you have to go to court and carry the burden (and my recollection from reading the statute is that it is a very high burden). The only other way it could be made public would be for the Commission to order it to be made public (because it isn't a trade secret), which to my knowledge has never happened with anything even remotely of commercial value and even then the owner of the information could go to court to stop it. Costs related to generation are the most obviously \"trade secret\" type information with which we deal. None of the utilities would try to claim it isn't protected, because then they would have to reveal their information. CUCA could try to get it in order to participate in the hearing, but CUCA generally supports IPP development (in general), and Jamie would have to sign a nondisclosure agreement and not reveal the information to anyone. For all practical purposes, Enron is safe. (Even if a claim were made, Enron could tie it up until the information was so old it was worth much less, if anything.)\"",

Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video conference was set up with two locations: one at DOE in Washington and one in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage. It was tentatively set up for 2:30 pm CST. I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron. Long-Term Forward Contracts Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm. It includes a draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1. Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California. Debt and Forebearance Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday. QF Contract Reformation Parties continued discussion No information was available by COB Friday. Major Issues State interest in resolving State willingness to raise retail rates Utilties' desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager Willingness to \"call off the dogs\" for the suppliers and to release them from legal action State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation Next Steps If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting, this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the week of Jan 15. If agreement is reached, a massive amount of work is required immediately, such as: FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16.

For the most part, the agreement looks pretty good. Most of my changes focused on the arbitration clause. Given the nature of this Agreement, we should be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for example, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron Energy Services).

If this acquisition goes forward, we will need to get organized---in the near term---on a number of logistical/due diligence tasks, but one thing we should start thinking about now is the \"disclosure\" issue. If the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this transaction , Equilon will probably want to sign a memorandum of understanding with us, and this may put us in a \"disclosure\" posture because at that point, we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a closure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment, based upon our past dealings with these people). Even without a signed document, the \"size/probability\" test would still be an issue for us to deal with. Everyone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's Board. Thanks.

Your feedback is very much appreciated. The survey helps identify inhibitors that keep you from accomplishing your job, while helping us assess the company's progress toward removing barriers that keep employees from achieving their personal best. Out of the 2,299 ENA/EGM/EIM employees invited to participate in the survey, 1,478, or 64% responded. Enron uses an outside firm, Watson Wyatt, to tabulate data and report results. A synopsis of what we heard from you has been added to our intranet site. The site address is http://home.ena.enron.com/pulse/. Our Strengths Strengths are based on the highest percentages of favorable responses to survey questions: * Employees are satisfied with their benefits 87% * Employees can believe information from top management 78% * Employees would recommend ENA/EGM/EIM as a good place to work 78% * Supervisors/Managers treat their employees fairly 76% * Supervisors/Managers encourage teamwork 73% * People are treated with respect 72% * ENA/EGM/EIM is well managed 72% Improvement Opportunities Improvement opportunities are based on the lowest percentages of favorable responses to survey questions: * Communication/Information Flow 35% * Information Technology 32% * Workload 26% We are pleased with these results because they exhibit a strong belief in Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence. These results are indicative of the quality of our employees at all levels. The Pulse survey enables us to focus on real issues affecting each employee. We will evaluate these results and consider remedies to the inhibitors that affect us on a daily basis. Your ideas are welcomed and we will be seeking your input. Great strides have been made since the first survey in 1996, and we intend to continue in this vein. Please plan to take part in future surveys, which will continue providing valuable information to help build a successful organization. Again, thank you for your input.",

The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions. ??????? Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial. ??????? In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects. ??????? Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds. ??????? Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds. ??????? The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01. The precise language is cited below. ??????? If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

The following two paragraphs have been rewritten to achieve recognition of the adequacy of the existing federal and state legislative framework. Under the procedures of the Directive, the Commission will have to make a determination of adequacy, thus, the rewrite to soften the suggestion of how they make that affirmative determination. Article 25 of the EU Directive calls for \"adequate,\" not \"equivalent\" protection, and the Financial Services Modernization Act, added to the existing federal and state legislative framework, establishes a high and enforceable standard for notice, choice, access, and security of consumer information. This comprehensive legislative framework achieves equivalency to the Data Protection Directive in protecting customer information covered by Title V of the FCRA. Over the next 18 months, the European Commission should follow the process of rulemaking and implementation of the Act during the Safe Harbor transition, in order to make a subsequent determination of adequacy based on how the Act is interpreted and applied. In the short-term the Commission should conclude that the federal and state financial services regulators, with their new statutory privacy mandate, can serve as the independent enforcement bodies for those financial services companies that choose to certify under the Safe Harbor. Please let me know if you object to this change. The comments are due today.

Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk. I answered positively, which is what the capital price addresses. The dash return is a blended debt and equity return.(?) Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate. I answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves. Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon. I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below outstanding. We will have to watch this issue carefully. Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem? Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough cash to operate. This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and not a rubber stamp. Rick ",

        "clean_content": " sbeck.nsf As we discussed in Rick's staff meeting, you can help your 7/1/00 go-live go more smoothly, whether you are implementing financials and HR or HR only. Here is one way. Timekeeping, though it seems mundane on the surface, is a focal point of the SAP integration. Entry and coding of time populates not just payroll, but projects and cost centers, real time. We will now have more flexibility to charge employee and contractor time to the areas they actually work (where people work on more than one area at a time). This will only happen to the extent that the business and cost center owners drive it. This capability is customizable not just by business unit or company, but by cost center within a company. To make this work HOW YOU WANT IT TO on 7/1, each \"organizational unit\" (as I said above, you can drive this in your cost center(s) only or across your BU) needs to be clear on questions such as: 1. Whether or not they want contractors to enter time in SAP 2. Whether you want positive timekeeping (each pay period specifying the cost center or projects one worked on) or \"exceptions\" only (e.g., vacation, sick time, etc) 3. Whether an approval process is desired and if so, what it is 4. Whether people will record their own time using the self service capability eHROnline (typically more precise and less handoffs) or whether they will continue to use a timekeeper (typically a little more convenient for people who (a) rarely have access to a computer or (b) work in many different areas and are not willing/able to identify and use cost center numbers or project codes 5. Whether people know the projects and cost center codes they should charge to Your leadership in clarifying this within your cost center and/or BU will be instrumental in driviing the level of change you desire, as well as minimizing the noise related to the 7/1 go -live. We have been using a variety of methods to communicate and drive much of this change, but the business drive for how much to utilize the tool is determined by you. The deadline for the first SAP time entry period is 3 pm Houston time on Friday, June 30. Despite all our collective efforts, I expect that it will be a few pay periods before we get each individual clear on what level of acitivity is desired from him by his cost center or company. Thanks for your help in getting through the transition period. Please call me or Andrea Yowman if you have any questions. ",

Jean Ryall will attend to hear discussion. Trying to have Skilling communicate key messages to Wohlens that consumer benefits will be less than expected because the wholesale rules advantage the current incumbents. Need to fix the market quickly. 2. PUC of Texas Public Meeting Feb 22 KEY POINT - Asking for delay of Protocol Decision until next Public Meeting on March 7. If delay, Ron McNamara and Jean Ryall will develop our next set of comments that need to be complete by Feb 26 for internal vetting and submitted to PUC. Critical that we are detailed. If no delay, Enron intends to seek Request for Rehearing at PUC (Marianne Carroll will lead effort). 3. Chairman Wood Meeting Feb 28 Ron McNamara and Jean Ryall should work to develop presentation to Chairman Wood on Enron issues that needs to be complete by Feb 26 for internal vetting. Please incorporate information on market activity from Bruce Sukaly and EES. 4. ERCOT Jean Ryall is seeking to win election to the ERCOT Board to replace Robin Kittel. Having a vote on the ERCOT Board is critical for our future success. Ron McNamara is working with ERCOT Change Committee to define necessary fixes assuming PUC approves Protocols. Jean Ryall and Ron McNamara are soliciting votes for our proposed changes to the Protocols currently. Whatever voting process occurs, we need to begin building the grass roots supports amongst the industry members. 5. Other Enron needs to begin developing specific changes to the ERCOT protocols. Ron McNamara and Jean Ryall need to coordinate if we need to hire outside consultants to support this effort. This is critical for a number of steps. Enron needs to develop metrics that we can begin recording that will highlight the failure of liquidity and price transparency. Jean Ryall should coordinate this activity to use in her political / regulatory activities. If there are any good ideas on what to use, please forward to Jean.

This invitation is extended to anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past two years. These informal, interactive forums will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year. Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues. They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, create a =01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron's executive management is on the=01&same page=018 about where Enron is going---and why. To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions: Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below. You will attend only one session.) ______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M ______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work: ? Each session will have approximately 20 participants. ? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue. ? This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations. ? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions. ? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum. ? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc. Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing, as to what session you will attend. We will try to honor requests for first choices as much as possible. Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).

In Section 3.1 (c), I'm assuming that the additional sections were added because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust. Is that correct? 2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I think belongs after the phrase that begins, \"if the effect of such failure...\" Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the end come from? Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals? 3. Section 3.11 should be made subject to Section 5.7 or vice versa. Carol",

Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer). Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron. The laundry list of topics discussed is attached. We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO. We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process. However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this. We will try to get others to sign on to the comments. Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included: ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript). Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time). Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining). All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes. Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future. This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us. Ray ",

You said, I believe, that senior management doesn't see a role for government affairs in the SEC/partnership issue. I think that's a fundamental error. I know I haven't been here as long as others, but after five months one things is crystal clear to me: There are people out there who really hate us, commercial competitors, politicians, interest group types, etc. I fully anticipate they will use recent events as a way to try and do us further harm in the political, regulatory, public perception arenas. I would hate for our senior management to think that this will play out in a nice orderly legal proceeding where everything is dealt with in terms of facts and reason and law. I believe this episode will play out more along the lines of CA, though on a smaller scale, where demagogues use this for their own advantages. I believe gov't affairs needs to play an important role sooner rather than later. ",

I came seeking business advice on the litigation and feel I accomplished a lot more. I apologize for not contacting you directly, but I was unaware that you were now responsible for all of the groups within ENA. Congratulations !!!!! Here is what I came away with: Litigation GE has proposed a settlement that includes a proposed press release unacceptable to PSM. I have our attorneys working on drafting a response to GE and pursing the possibility of eliminating the joint press release altogether. If common ground cannot be reached we will pursue other legal options. Private Placement The book has been released to Enron & Calpine. I understand your position concerning participation and the question of the ongoing litigation. I am very open to the additional warrant option. Mike Miller talked to me about it after the meeting and we will discuss it next week. New Albany Retrofit I have asked my engineers to formulate a plan to upgrade the units at New Albany with our latest 6 ppm liners and fuel nozzles. We are currently manufacturing a full set for a 7EA machine. We haven't firmed up the test dates but we need to seek approval by ENA & OEC to use one of the Doyle machines. This is a significant leap in technology that many of our clients are extremely interested in. We now have the only single digit dry low Nox system that can be used on multiple machine types to include Westinghouse 501D5A, ABB 11 N1/N2, GE F6 / F7. FT4 Mobile Unit I understand from Mike Miller you want to slow the pace down on the first ten units to \"Learn out\" the manufacturing and business process. This will ease our pain level on schedule. My engineering staff is very excited with this program because it involves aircraft engines and they can apply their true skills. We just hired the program manager named George Kirsby. He is currently in charge of the $4 billion Joint Strike Fighter engine design program for Pratt Whitney / Boeing. I figure he should be able to manage the mobile unit project. At some time in the near future I would like to arrange a program presentation for you in Houston. I need to give Kirsby a few weeks to get his arms around the project and will propose dates for you in the future. We need to expedite the formation of the Joint Venture company as we are already being approached with deals to place these units. I really value your support and you can always count on our loyalty to Enron.

I think that the structure of these deals may ultimately differ from the structure described in the LOI and term sheet, but I'm not sure what the current thinking is on the structure right now. I do know that some more thought has been put into the broker access concept since we developed the Natsource LOI (upon which the other two were based), and that we have never gone back to the Natsource LOI to make sure that it represented \"the deal.\" The LOIs/Term sheets on these deals are non-binding, so I don't think there is any material legal exposure for sending them out and starting discussions with these counterparties. However, I think that when Mark Taylor returns, we need to put our heads together and make sure that these proposals match up with how we our current thinking on these structures. If there is a big difference, we can talk about approaching our counterparties on these LOIs and explaining our new approach.

Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7) To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii) Budget (due Jan 3, 2002) To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii) Seating Plans Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv) Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis. Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are. I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this. I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings). The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.

        "clean_content": "NOPR Comments Docket No. RM99-2-000 - 72 - In March 1998, a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders 113/ filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure. 114/ Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition, the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market. For example, the Petition asserts: Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing, rather than accommodating, transactions. Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical, accurate information across control areas. This can take the form of out-of-date or incorrect postings of ATC or, in some instances, intentional withholding of actual ATC. Regardless of the cause, more transmission capability 111/ Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference, Docket No. RM95-9-003 (July 18, 1997), transcript at 23. 112/ Id. at 28. 113/ The group consists of a number of power marketers and users, including, for example, Coalition for a Competitive Electric Market, ELCON, Electric Clearinghouse, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. 114/ Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or Reconsider Certain Open-Access Commercial Practices, Docket No. RM98-5-000. Docket No. RM99-2-000 - 73 - is physically available than is being released for sale. [115/] The Petition alleges the existence of \"ATC exclusions, inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities, and therefore, prevent reasonable access to the grid.\" 116/ The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side; an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling; and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale. 117/ EPSA, the trade association representing certain power suppliers, filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences: EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers, by, for example, minimizing reported available transmission capability (ATC), delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS, or otherwise manipulating market operations. 118/ EPSA further stated that, \"The manipulation of ATC -- whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS 115/ Petition at 7-8. 116/ Id. at 15. 117/ Id. at Appendix D. 118/ EPSA Comments, Docket No. RM98-5-000, at 2 (filed September 21, 1998). Docket No. RM99-2-000 - 74 - management -- is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power suppliers.\" 119/ At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans, we were told by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City, Mississippi, of a specific instance of what it considered to be discriminatory treatment: Yazoo City, as a participant, has experienced first hand an individual [transmission] owner's continued ability to use its ownership and control [of] transmission to disadvantage competitors, notwithstanding Order 888's mandate of non-discriminatory transmission access. The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a 10 MW power sale because of transmission restrictions, but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself. 120/ The representative concluded that Orders Nos. 888 and 889 have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved \"as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmission-dependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation assets at increased cost to competitors.\" 119/ Id. at 8. 120/ Comments of Robert D. Priest on behalf of the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City, Regional ISO Conference (New Orleans), Transcript at 201-03. After hearing this assertion, Entergy Services, Inc. filed a letter in which it stated that it was unable to identify any Entergy-imposed restrictions that would have prevented the power purchase. See Letter in Docket No. PL98-5-000 (filed July 2, 1998). Docket No. RM99-2-000 - 75 - One specific area where there have been allegations that transmission owners are using ATC to favor their own merchant operations concerns the calculation and use of Capacity Benefit Margin (CBM). Although there is no single accepted definition, CBM is generally used to mean an amount of transmission transfer capability reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet their generation reliability requirements. 121/ Some utilities subtract CBM from their total transmission capability to arrive at ATC. There is no uniform method for calculating CBM. The ability to withhold CBM to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability advantage for the transmission provider, but may give the transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold ATC over paths and interconnections useful to its generation competitors. The use of CBM is an issue that is currently being considered in several cases pending before the Commission. 122/ For example, with respect to the formation of the PJM ISO, the Commission noted that it was not demonstrated that the PJM Pool's historical practice of withholding firm transmission interface capacity as a substitute for installed generating reserves is 121/ NERC, Available Transfer Capability Definitions and Determinations (June 1996), at 14. 122/ The Commission recently noticed a technical conference, to be held May 20 and 21, 1999, on the issue of CBM. See Capacity Benefit Margin in Computing Available Transmission Capacity, Notice of Technical Conference, Docket No. EL99- 46-000. Docket No. RM99-2-000 - 76 - consistent with our open access policies. The Commission observed that the load serving entities that own generating capacity within the PJM control area appeared to benefit from this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load serving entities. 123/ The Commission set the issue for further briefing and it remains pending. In another pending proceeding concerning WPSC's CBM calculation, two of the parties assert that CBM \"removes firm transmission capacity from open access offerings, thereby raising an unnecessary and unjustifiable barrier to competition,\" and \"fosters discrimination by giving merchant functions gatekeeping control over CBM-related transmission access and by giving individual interface transmission owners broad discretion over where and how much CBM is withdrawn from ATC.\" 124/ In the same proceeding, Electric Clearinghouse, Inc. asserts that \"the CBM set-aside embodies undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires because it ensures certain users a priority over the reserved transmission interface capacity to the exclusion of other firm transmission users.\" 125/ As we stated above, we fully recognize that these are assertions made in pending cases in which we have not yet made 123/ PJM, 81 FERC at 62,277. 124/ Protest of Madison Gas & Electric Company and Wisconsin Public Power Inc., Docket No. EL98-2-003, at 3 (filed August 21, 1998). 125/ Protest of Electric Clearinghouse, Inc., Docket No. EL98-2- 003, at 3 (filed August 21, 1998). Docket No. RM99-2-000 - 77 - findings. They are referenced here as illustrative of the suspicions in the industry of continuing opportunities for discriminatory treatment that may disadvantage certain competitors where generation owners continue to operate transmission.

        "clean_content": " jdasovic.nsf Following are two issues that are currently being debated to which I am requesting feedback in order to submit an Enron position prior to the Steering Committee being held this week. Planning: Parties are lobbying language to disclose all planning projects permitting anyone to join provided the interested party pays the incremental cost i.e. TO #1 wants to build a 2000 MW Kv line and maintain rights to all 2000 MW, TO #2 wants to increase the lines capability by 400 MW and retain rights to all 400 MW. In this scenario, TO #2 would have to pay all costs associated with upgrading the line. The argument is that in an RTO world this scenario is irrelevant, however, I see this as a potential seams issue. ADR: Parties are lobbying to change language from mandatory binding arbitration with limited appeal to FERC TO mandatory binding arbitration only if both parties agree with the ability to bypass and go directly to FERC. (All entities with the exception of SWRTA currently enforce the former. SWRTA additionally has a provision that calls for a pre-arbitration peer review.) FYI: Class definitions are such that WAPA qualifies for membership in only one class and the regions do not fit the affiliate definition. Therefore, if each region wants to join and have one vote per region in said class, they must each pay $5000 and the larger entity must pay the net energy to load ratio of total load with the larger region collecting pro rata compensation from the other regions.

I'd like to begin by apologizing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over thelast couple of weeks. These have been very hard times and I know that people have wanted information. It has taken us nearly a week to sort throughwho will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) who do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.

It is not entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power looks like for the Enron estate now. As I understand it, there are two primary initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.The first is the disposition of our development projects that are alreadywell under way. Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effort together with the Portland asset development team. This effort has been ongoing since December. The second is the disposition of our west power commodity positions. Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Richter, Ed Baughman among others. I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul toget advice on how people in Portland should proceed. I would recommend talking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction. I have placed a call to several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response. I am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinatethe power procurement and delivery efforts. As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron has already begun. People who will continue to work for Enron will be located on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor. We hope to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week. Moves withinthe 3rd Floor will take place the following week. The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hurdle. While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be onor about February 6th. Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperationover the last few weeks. These have been really horrible times as the Enron story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are finding out about their future with Enron and UBS. I know that this hasn't been easy for anyone. I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the awesome team that we have put together. Whether you are going to UBS, remaining with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on thisteam the best in their future endeavors. It has been a distinct honor to work with each and every one of you. Regards, Tim ",

With respect to the Gathering Services Agreement noted in item (4), it incorporates revisions made subsequent to the draft that I e-mailed to you on September 13. For the most part the revisions are too minor to be worthy of flagging to you. The more substantive revisions are as follows: (A) Section 5.1 was revised to match Section 9.1 of the Gas Purchase Agreement, (B) in Exhibit A, the Fort Union In-Service Date was revised to reflect the fact that it has already occurred, (C) in Exhibit A, Section L.1(i)., the reference to third party, and the related text, was deleted; and (D) in Exhibit A, Sections M.2, N.9, and N.10 were added. With further regard to the Gathering Services Agreement, please let me know if you want to use the measurement provisions that I e-mailed to you on September 13, or just use the provisions included in Enron's draft of the Agreement. As I mentioned to you, these agreements still require some work, but they should at least advance the process and give you something to discuss with Enron next week. As I also mentioned to you, due to fairly extensive rearranging of the provisions of the agreements, the black-lined versions may not be easy to follow. <<Gas Purchase-2.doc>> <<Gas Purchase-2clean>> <<GAS PURCHASE-CMP>> <<Gas Gathering-3>> <<Gas Gathering-3clean>> <<GAS GATHERING-CMP>> - Gas Purchase-2.doc - Gas Purchase-2clean.dat - GAS PURCHASE-CMP.dat - Gas Gathering-3.dat - Gas Gathering-3clean.dat - GAS GATHERING-CMP.dat ",

        "clean_content": "Enron case study Dear Christie: First I wanted to thank you belatedly for the excellent organization you provided in setting up our meetings in Houston a couple of weeks ago. The information we got was right on target and Meg and I came back with full notebooks and bulging heads. It was a very useful and productive trip from our point of view, and we very much appreciated your very professional organization of the process. Having worked on the drafts over the last couple of weeks, we have come to the conclusion that the material is just too rich to fit into a single case. In dividing our story into two parts, we focused our first case on the transformational story that unfolded during the 1990s, not only on the strategic changes occurring within the company but also on the organizational and managerial redesign that supported and drove those new directions. The second case will encapsulate some of that company background, but will focus in more detail on the way in which the new Enron environment sparked the Enron Online innovation. I have used this approach a couple of times previously, focusing on entrepreneurship at 3M and on human resource management at Microsoft, and for your information I will forward copies of those two-part cases as models of what we are working towards. The other thing I wanted to update you on was our plans to make these cases as interactive as possible. Given Enron's transition into the \"new economy\" and particularly the focus of the Enron Online case, we feel it is very important to develop these cases in a multimedia manner. This means that we will try to provide links to video material, Websites, streamed interviews, etc. wherever they can support the development of the story line. The videos you sent us following our last visit are a very good starting point, but we should probably try to schedule videotaped interviews with Jeff Skilling, Ken Lay, and Louise Packard for sometime in the near future -- certainly before Christmas. Thanks again for all your help and support in getting us this far. Our hope is that we can get some drafts to you over the next couple of weeks for your review and input. Meanwhile, Meg will be contacting you to see if we can set up a day for the videotaped interviews. We are greatly looking forward to completing our work on this very exciting project.

In the months of September and to date in October, unbilled fees are approximately $11,000. As to future work, which would include negotiating and finalizing the Interconnection Agreement and negotiating the sale agreement, I estimate $30,000.

As a result of this, Enron will not be re-signing any new ISDA's etc.?? However, Section 7 to the ISDA Master agreement governing Transfers requires the prior written consent for any transfer of \"any interest or obligation\" under the Agreement.? Our view is that the participation to BTM does qualify as a tranfer of an any \"interest or obligation\", ergo we need Enron's consent.? Attached please find a proposed Consent from Enron prepared by my lawyer.? This is the only document that we require signed by Enron.? Please take note of the key language contained therein: ??????? \"Enron hereby consents to RBC assigning a 50% participation interest in the Swap Documents to Bank of Tokyo-???? ?????? Mitsubishi, Ltd., New York Branch; provided that (a) RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap Documents shall remain ??????? unchanged, (b) RBC shall remain solely responsible to Enron for the performance of such obligations and (c) Enron shall ??????? continue to deal solely and directly with RBC in connection with RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap Documents.\" The commodity swap between Chase and RBC will be \"split\" and each of RBC and BTM will have a Swap with Chase for one-half the amount. Sara(s), please advise whether you are comfortable with our approach and whether you require any changes to the Consent.? BTM has reviewed the Participation agreement and is moving forward to getting the doc's approved internally...we're targeting for a close mid next week (the week of Dec 11) and accordingly your execution of the Consent within that timeframe would be much appreciated.?

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer. CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999. T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market. The market went away effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn Fuel's system. We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either. T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive any and all \"cover\" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to April 1, 2000. John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this need to be included in the CES true-up? Also, John wants to know if he should sign the letter?.

I'll have Heather set up a meeting for next week. thanks bob ---------------------- Forwarded by Bob M Hall/NA/Enron on 03/29/2001 11:34AM --------------------------- Enron North America Corp. From: Rita Wynne @ ECT 03/29/2001 11:05 AM To:Bob M Hall/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject:New Profit Centers Bob, Per our conversation - on this past Tuesday, a group met from VM, Gas Acctg. and East Risk to discuss the recording of the 12 east desks and 7 central desks to SAP. Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East will record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas were done in Feb.'s g/l). According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA for each of the profit centers (19 in total). As we discussed, VM does not have the appropriate Unify reports or manpower to support this level of accounting at this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we have in the past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their side of the UA4 calc. to match us. With the foresight of eventually going to profit center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be significant changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle thislower level of reporting. I believe the flash is already being done at the different profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still performing their analysis at a more consolidated level. There were discussions inthe meeting that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opinion that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the organization - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process will need to be able to handle this level of detail. Of course, no decisions were made in our meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will remain unchanged for this month. Please let me know if you want to discuss further. Thanks! ",

Thank you. _______________________________________________________________ Jerry Fox reports that Peoples is reviewing the Peitition and plans to generate a new draft. Jerry indicates that Peoples does not think it will be possible to identify a standard or guideline which the ICC could consider with respect to the \"complex\" transactions covered by the agreement (for example, pricing within a designated percentage or amount of an index level). Do you have any thoughts on this? The Petitiion is asking that the ICC approve these transactions in advance, so it is best to explain as fully as possible what the transactions will look like. Jerry is also not sure what can be said about why these transaction benefit the public (the standard for approval under 7-101). I had assumed that the transactions might use otherwise idle capacity or create a credit to gas cost otherwise recoverable under the Illinois PGA. Jerry is still considering this. Jerry reports that Mary Klyshaaf and others spoke to the ICC Staff about this and suggested that the affiliate agreement should be approved because transactions under it are similar to transactions currently on-going with non-affiliates. Jerry, however, is uncertain about the nature of these transactions. I suggested that one approach might be to identlfy some of the referenced transactions to see what can be said about why they are in the public interest. If you have any ideas on these points, please let me know. Jerry seems to agree that the Petition would be improved if information could be added to explain why transactions under the agreement would be beneficial to Peoples' customers. ",

He has been with Texaco, first in Houston and now in Burbank, since he earned his joint law degree and MBA in 1990. Within Texaco, he is a transactional attorney and has two specialties: First, he supports Texaco Global Gas and Power in all aspects of project development and finance, in its efforts to develop cogeneration power plants in domestic and international locations. Secondly, he has provided legal counsel to the Texaco Marketing Department with a focus on franchising and marketing/distribution as well other transactional matters and contracts, including licensing, trademarks and antitrust matters. Woody is not from the Portland area nor does he have family here, but he has travelled here extensively and would like to relocate to Portland. From a timing aspect, Woody has another in-house offer from a bay area employer with a two-week time table in which to reply. He has expressed high interest in an Enron opportunity and would be pleased to discuss his background more in detail in a telephone pre-screening interview.

The amendments take effect as of February 1, 2001 and govern transactions that close on or after that date. As anticipated, the amendments increase the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $50 million, and they eliminate the 15% prong of the size-of-transaction threshold. They also eliminate the size-of-person threshold for transactions with a value exceeding $200 million. Congress projects that about half of filings will be eliminated under the new thresholds.

Enfolio Agreement between NUI Utilities and ENA - The version (including all Exhibits) that Stacy sent on April 11 (5:23 p.m.) is the final and is acceptable. I have asked Terri Sue to forward NUI's Notice Information (Exhibit A) to Stacy. Stacy, upon receipt, can you please generate the final agreement? 2. Physical Transaction Agreement - I need to review Section 4 with Bob Lurie who will be back in the office tomorrow. 3. April Transaction Confirmation Letter - Stacy, this letter should be addressed to Thomas E. Smith, Director, Energy Planning (who signed the Confirmation). Also, please confirm that the Exhibits are NUI Confirmation Nos. 31060 and 46669. 3. Swap Transaction Agreements - I am attaching a revised version of the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.4 from Enron's review. As Mark and I discussed, NUI Corporation, not NUI Utilities, will be the Guarantor. In addition, I have modified the form of Guaranty to make it clear that it only applies to these two Swaps; this is similar to what Enron had agreed to when we were contemplating an NUI Corp. Guaranty for the Enfolio Agreement. I have made this change to the Guaranty because I am not satisfied that the discussion within the Confirmation that purports to limit the scope of the Guaranty is sufficient. I think the limitations need to be set forth within the four corners of the Guaranty itself. If acceptable, the same changes should be made to the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.5. <<ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc>> - ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc ",

        "clean_content": "Alberta Power Purchase Arrangement Auction I have considered on a preliminary basis the potential use of a limited liability subsidiary of Enron Canada Corp. for the purposes of bidding on the PPAs. The issues and preliminary answers are in summary the following: 1. It is not clear that Alberta would permit qualification of another Enron Canada entity at this point. I believe that it would be more sellable if that Enron Canada entity was a replacement to Enron Canada as a Qualified Bidder, rather than an additional Qualified Bidder, and if that Enron Canada entity was similarly guaranteed by Enron Corp. I need to discuss this matter further with Rob Hemstock, Alberta and Charles River. 2. With respect to the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as mentioned, it is not free from doubt, but I believe that the Guarantee is only in respect of bidding on, and paying for a PPA and not for ongoing performance or payment obligations under the PPA. In other words, the Guarantee guarantees \"Obligations\" which relate to the bidding process and not to the PPAs themselves, although there is some wording which could be viewed as including in \"Obligations\" ongoing obligations with respect to the PPAs themselves. 3. With respect to limiting liability, such Enron Canada entity would limit exposure for a successfully acquired PPA to the contributed capital to such Enron Canada entity, assuming the Enron Corp. Guarantee would not extend past the bidding process as noted in paragraph 2 above, and subject to the common law relating to \"piercing the corporate veil\", which in essence means that the limited liability protection of a shareholder through a corporate entity can be looked through if the courts determine that the corporate entity was established merely for the purposes of avoiding liabilities properly attributable to the shareholder. Although this is a difficult test to prove given the intended purposes of corporate and other limited liability entities, it is best to establish the limited liability entity in such a way that it has the greatest appearance of an operating company (for example, a separate board of directors, separate management, separate employees, separate operating agreements and leases, etc.). As mentioned, however, it is all a matter of degree and generally speaking it is difficult to establish a case where the courts will allow the \"corporate veil\" protecting shareholders to be \"pierced\". 4. With respect to capturing tax losses incurred in the limited liability entity, if Enron Canada is the sole shareholder so that there is no change of control on a winding-up into Enron Canada, Enron Canada can avail of tax losses incurred in the Enron Canada entity through a winding-up. Obviously, however, this would mean that Enron Canada takes on the liabilities of the special purpose entity as a result of the winding-up, including the liabilities for any acquired PPA. Otherwise, the general rule is that the tax losses, if any, would be captured inside in the Enron Canada entity and would not be available to be used against Enron Canada's taxable income. 5. With respect to Project Stanley, there is really no established case authority directly on point, but the better view is that any sanction, if and when imposed on Enron Canada, would be imposed in a way that would prevent Enron Canada from indirectly avoiding the application of the sanction, such as by moving certain business operations into a special purpose entity. In other words, if Canada or Alberta were intent on suspending or affecting Enron Canada's abilities to transact through the PPAs or otherwise in the Alberta Power Pool, it is likely that the sanction would be imposed upon Enron Canada and its affiliated entities also transacting through the Power Pool. Based upon the preliminary answers, please let me know if you want a more detailed legal opinion to consider these issues further and whether Hemstock and I should be approaching the Government to qualify a special purpose entity.

        "clean_content": " vkamins.nsf It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will have a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad array of industries. Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch. Since launch, we have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of over $25 billion. EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world. We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very specific reason. In addition to providing a web-based platform for transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the site. We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and sell at the posted price. This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typical eCommerce concept) into a true market. There are very few, if any, competitors that can provide this capability. We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies. If we are correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enron. Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this opportunity. Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a broad range of industries. It is likely that this business will ultimately be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution, wholesale, retail and broadband services. Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and success. To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchant functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadband. Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mike McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial Officer. These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron's Executive Committee. Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net Works. It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as an Enron global function. Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the development of worldwide technology standards and platforms. EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now be a part of Enron Net Works. The success of EnronOnLine enables us to utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the following individuals are included in Enron Net Works along with their current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Jay Fitzgerald, New Markets Identification; Bruce Garner, Metals; and Greg Piper, Pulp and Paper. Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational design and will provide full details on this exciting new business opportunity.",

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry. Thank you.

        "clean_content": " VKAMINS (Non-Privileged).pst Thank you for your interest!!! Judgment Courses offers an extensive training course in \"How to Collect Money Judgments\" . *s7- If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments can earn you very substantial income . If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a Money Judgment against them. You are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact: \"Its now up to you to collect on the Judgment\". The court does not require the loser to pay you. The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found. The result is that millions of Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten. \"In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a dime.\" The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions. Right now in the United States there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more Judgments take its place. We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed. With our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing Money Judgments. By following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of Money Judgments. The income potential is substantial in this profession. We have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices. Today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates. Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies, police officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us for reports. Many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars. Legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10% interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments. Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to $500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the payment of the principal. Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per year. This is just for interest, not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income. Typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars. 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43% are women and 36% are part time . One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are working on will be there when you return. The Judgments are still in force, they do not disappear. The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you are. You are not a collection agency. Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing are as follows: Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who to write to) 8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them unless you want to. You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and 50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for $2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00. You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you. They range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc. The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to 1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge $6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $25.00. Once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located. (Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course) When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to the original Judgment holder. Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of Judgment to the court. (Included in the course) Quote's from several of our students: Thomas in area code 516 writes us: \"I just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars . Your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on. After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in area code 314 stated to us: \" I am now making $2,000.00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in judgments I am collecting on now.\" After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated \" I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately $500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I will have to hire someone to help out\" Marshal in area code 407 states to us \"I feel bad, you only charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months\" From the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following: With our course you can own your own successful business. A business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to retire on and travel the world. A business which is extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every day is new and exciting. None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen for many others already. Make it happen for you! If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation on your part. Please call us at 1--4 0 6 --6 5 2 --0 1 9 4 .. We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to 9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week . If you call this number you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel. They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation. Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not.

Note the lunch will be delivered at 11:30. Tracy & John, can you arrange the Agenda accordingly and reminder that Eric Gadd will be leaving at 12:00 so his area should be covered before then. Can we achieve the business goals with the break? Is this ambitious? If you want to extend the meeting time, I have extended the conference room (49C2) till 1:30. The conference room is booked at 2:00 by Steve Harris/Drew Fossum but, I could ask them to adjust their meeting if more time is needed. Please advise.

Note that a CBR update was completed on July 11th and as per Tracy, the information would be fairly current to update Stan. A NB Strategy meeting was also completed on July 19th in Omaha. 8/14, as per Tracy, Stan referred back to Danny. Danny suggested canceling and thought we had already done so. I advised him that the Quarter Forecast Review w/ Stan was canceled but, not this particular meeting. CANCEL?? 3rd CE Review w/ Stan, Tuesday, September 18th Confirmed on Danny's calendar ",

The Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to CA Energy Development II, LLC and the GE generator set will be in the same form as item (i) above with changes to reflect the proper LLC. To expedite matters, these revised drafts are being sent to you before review by InterGen with the understanding that InterGen may have additional changes and comments. In addition to changes necessitated by the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas, the letter agreements have been revised to reflect the following requirements of InterGen: (i) The parent guaranty on behalf of Sweetgum Energy LP has been deleted; (ii) A mutual covenant requiring the Parties to use all reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent as been added to the end of Section 3; and (iii) A no shop clause on the part of ENA and its affiliates has been added as a new Section 17. The reference to the TRY Ventures International agreement was deleted from the letter agreement relating to the ABB transformer since it is my understanding that the ABB transformer was not covered by Coral's agreement with TRY. ENA would nevertheless be protected by the general language of the clause. Although InterGen is still reviewing these documents for tax and other concerns, for now the only contemplated changes to the LLC Agreements and the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters are those needed to reflect the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas. InterGen is still reviewing the Facility Agreement and exhibits thereto. I have passed on ENA's suggestion regarding the extension of the closing date, but have not yet had a response from InterGen. Doug Pedigo will be tied up tomorrow morning, but Doug and I are available after lunch for a telephone conference to discuss any comments you have on the closing.

You continue to make it happen. We recognize that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron's business goals, and we are pleased that many of you have shared in the company's financial success through Enron stock options. As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program. Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron's continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package. On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program). It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, is as follows: ? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations. ? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.) ? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000. ? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant of stock options. Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program, among other good reasons=01( that's why. In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your questions, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your Human Resources representative. Note: In addition to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, granting of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron companies' employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refine the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

        "clean_content": " kmann.nsf I enjoyed getting to know you yesterday. By the way, I wanted to follow up on a few items related to the Hub transaction: 1. The competition restrictions commence August 10th (see the definition of \"Restricted Period\" in the agreement), but no DASH was circulated at the time the LLC agreement was signed. I believe it was intended that some other approval/sign-off procedure would be implemented after the closing. Achieving the appropriate internal Enron sign-offs is critical, so please let us know what (if anything) we can do to assist in this process --- whatever it might be. 2. Our deadline for proposing a list of grandfathered contracts to PMW is June 25th. That's a week from next Sunday, and it is the same date by which we are supposed to finalize the Agency Agreement. Since it appears that Peoples does not expect to get back to us for at least a week on the Agency Agreement, we might want to think about amending the LLC agreement to push the deadline back. 3. Other matters on our \"to-do\" list include (i) filing qualifications to do business where necessary outside Illinois, (ii) providing each of Enron's restricted affiliates' marketing representatives with a copy of the Restricted Activities provisions, (iii) putting the member guaranty arrangements in place, and (iv) finalizing the Risk Guidelines. 4. Termination rights are triggered if we fail to meet the deadlines in 2 and 4(iv) above. Thanks! DT",

Haedicke FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net Corporation HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm Before the Internet you could not Shepardize for $4 or Keycite(r) for $3.75. You had to be a subscriber. Today all you need is a credit card. See, e.g.: http://www.westlaw.com/SubOptions/other.wl see also: http://web.lexis.com/xchange/Forms/uas/Catalog.asp In fact, everything published to http://www.westlaw.com and http://www.lexis.com is available on-demand whenever you cannot quickly find the right answer elsewhere for free, or for short money using TheLaw.net. Why is this significant and why would we advertise our competitors? Simple. With everything in the \"Wexis\" universe always just a click or two away on the Internet, you no longer need to pick and choose resources and interestingly, you no longer necessarily require expensive subscriptions. For years, the management question has been whether to make that onerous annual commitment to Company A or Company B. But thanks to the Internet, you can have just what you need, at the precise time you need it on a pay-per-view basis. Choosing the right tool for the job is the trick. But that's easy once you know your options. --USEFUL BELLS AND WHISTLES OR TEDIOUS OVERKILL? TheLaw.net Custom Browser lacks some of Wexis' bells and whistles. For instance, using our meta-searchable database of four million plus Federal and state appellate judicial opinions, you can quickly call up a relevant list of cases that have construed the statute, rule, reg or cite that you need to learn more about. It is just as easy to quickly jump to the relevant excerpt of each case to assess relevancy. What's missing are the little colored arrows indicating whether a Court followed or distinguished your case. For some, the lack of every conceivable enhancement can be a deal breaker. Others, however, prefer to draw their own conclusions by checking cases for themselves because at some point in their career something happened which caused them to question whether the best lawyers are the ones still writing headnotes. Depending on the job at hand, the mind numbing array of costly, high falutin' Wexis icons and symbols scattered throughout a document, may be very useful or very confusing and unnecessary. --THE INTERNET: AN INCUBATOR FOR CHOICE We advertise our competitors because we recognize that Wexis has been a work in progress for generations and we know that you will probably always have a relationship with them at some level; subscription, pay-per-view, or otherwise. Certainly, factors such as practice area, jurisdiction, organization size and culture all contribute to assembling what is, for you, the best matrix of tools for the job. Far be it from us to say precisely where we fit in. This, by definition, is an individualized decision only you can make as a sophisticated consumer of information services. Experience teaches, however, that by deploying TheLaw.net in your world: ----you may discover that your online productivity increases ten fold ----the list of expensive subscription items may be much shorter ----you may discover that it makes sense to use Wexis only a transaction basis We have subscribers who will tell you that this is a great way to run a business. Clients' expectations are set at the front end. You recover 100% of your costs on the back side and the embarrassment of finessing or eating unanticipated charges are added to what we hope is a long list of learning experiences. See, e.g., http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm General practitioners frequently see us as a sensible, low flat-rate go-to resource and when necessary, they supplement with Wexis. Specialists sometimes choose to cling to their elegant practice or jurisdiction specific slice of Wexis, adding us on as \"meter insurance\" for those occasions when The Plan doesn't cut. All seem to recognize that TheLaw.net has indeed developed the definitive best practices software solution for getting around online; a solution that allows you to instantly begin leveraging tens of thousands of critical web based documents and databases on behalf of your online enterprise. --A FIRM FOUNDATION AT A LOW, FLAT-RATE --------$395 annually for you --------$575 for you and a partner --------$1195 for your five-user workgroup --------Unlimited access to everything we have --------30-Day Unconditional Money Back Guarantee --------Enterprise Licenses are also available.

        "clean_content": "Re: Korean Consents - further Mark, I will look into the point you raise. It sounds like \"Oldco\" would be the same legal entity that now holds the JV ownership (indirectly). Enron Corp is not defined in terms of individuals. Thus, it seems there should not be a legal issue. Furhter, the Korean government, has been visited by no less than 3 very senior Enron officials within the past year. A change could make officials more reluctant to talk with Enron because the company is constantly changing people. Otherwise, it is hard for me to see why an official would want to cause trouble over a \"domestic\" (within Enron) matter. My guess is the challenge would come from SK Corp, who might feel \"we\" are trying to escape without living through the \"honeymon\" period and not \"set off\" the Right-of-refusal. There may be a desire to use various techniques, including causing political trouble, to force either Newco management or Oldco management to buy him out. Half of the \"hurt\" they would fall on them however, so it would seem there would be a hesitancy to use that approach. That would mean that activities of Enron, Korea might be threatened. So the risk seems like it would be dependent on what business, other than CGC joint venture, that Enron Korea might get involve in. Thus far, there isn't an active operation being run through EK. It is late (or early, actually). I will consider the point more after some sleep. Mike D. ______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________ Author: Mark Schroeder, July 4, 2000 To: Mike Dahlke Thanks. I think the one dimension that I would like to see addressed a bit more explicitly is: If the interest in the holding company itself is transferred, or the management control of the holding company changes hands, e.g., \"Enron Corp.\" (old) is no longer chaired by Lay, who will chair \"Enron Corp. (new)\", but Enron Corp. (old) still is the JV interest owner, in addition to the legal requiriements, and consultation with locals you note below, is there any risk of \"political\" interference, such that they might extract concessions from the parties to the transaction before it could go forward. Not necessarily fair, but they might have some leverage or perceive that they do. If such a transaction goes forward, the dealmakers want to know this, so as to be able to fairly judge the risk, and how to allocate it in the deal. thanks mcs ",

I still haven't made the change regarding the take-or-pay problem (I left that paper at home in my briefcase and will make the change tomorrow morning). Also, I haven't added anything regarding the conflict that arose over pay for new hires nor have I received the Business Week e-mail from you.

        "clean_content": " jdasovic.nsf On Friday, I attended a meeting with Ken Lay and Karen Denne that Mike Peevey and David Freeman requested. Mike Peevey was President of Southern California Edison before founding NEV (which he eventually sold to AES). Freeman is General Manager of LADWP. The Governor hired Peevey to be his chief energy advisor. Freeman is the Governor's chief negotiator responsible for signing power contracts on behalf of DWR now that the Legislature has passed AB1X and the Governor has signed it. John Burton, the leader of the State Senate, is responsible for getting the Freeman the job of chief negotiator, but Peevey was clearly in charge. Also at the meeting was Vikram Budraja, former SVP of power systems and planning for Edison. He's now a private consultant that Freeman hired to help him with the contract negotiations. Peevey asked for the meeting to urge Enron to respond to DWR's RFP issued on Friday. Peevey/Freeman want to announce a package of deals on Tuesday. They implied that they've already got some deals done and expect to have 8+ deals to announce on Tuesday, though they gave no details other than to say that they've got a deal with Calpine (as reported in the press). Their plan is to announce on Tuesday the names of the suppliers they've signed with, the total number of megawatts signed, and the average price per MW. They are concerned that the media will want them to make public the details of each individual deal, which for obvious reasons they don't want to do. Peevey and Freeman also said that they don't want to sign too many long-term contracts though they recognize that there's a trade-off between term and price. Ken Lay told them that Enron would respond. ENA is preparing a response. He also told them that EES was working on a plan to reduce demand at our customers' facilities and that the plan would be completed and ready for implementation very soon. I've summarized the points that Ken Lay made and the responses from Peevey and Freeman: It would be difficult to enter into contracts without some assurance that DWR is creditworthy. Response from Peevey/Freeman: AB1X provides DWR the funds necessary=01*beginning on Friday, Feb 1st=01*to purchase the power necessary to fill the utilities' short position. KenLay pressed them on this point and Peevey insisted that AB1X provides the funds needed to pay suppliers. The RFP should give suppliers maximum flexibility in coming up with proposals. Response from Peevey/Freeman: Be as creative as possible. All offers will be considered (despite the language contained in the RFP). The only customers who have been protected from California's failed restructuring law are customers who chose another provider under Direct Access. In addition, one of the quickest ways to help solve California's shortage is to work with customers to reduce demand and develop on-site generation. Taking away Direct Access and access to customers generally=01*as AB1X does=01*is therefore a dumb idea and must be reversed. Response from Peevey: He agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill. He affirmed what we already know=01*that the head of the Senate oversight committee=01* Debra Bowen=01*is working on a =01&clean-up=018 bill to remove the prohibition. In response to Ken Lay's points that California needed to make sure that utility interconnection and stand-by rates didn't continue to impede on-site generation, Peevey and Freeman said that the Governor understood the problem and was prepared to fix it. Siting laws have got to be streamlined and California (i.e., the Governor) has got to credibly commit to the swift development of new power plants in order to push the forward curve down. Response from Peevey/Freeman: The Governor is scheduled to offer a plan this week that is targeted at expediting siting and development. DWR should accept demand reduction bids at the same time that it accepts supply-side bids. Response from Peevey/Freeman: They agreed but said that there is extreme political pressure to announce the signing of some supply deals on Tuesday in order to prove to legislators that DWR will be able to keep the lights on, and at a =01&reasonable=018 price. They also need to sign some deals in light of the fact that the feds are very unlikely to extend the DOE order forcing suppliers to sell to the IOUs. Once they've shown that they can manage the supply side, Peevey and Freeman said they want to quickly turn their attention to demand-side bidding. These are the highlights. I'd be happy to give more details on the Monday morning \\call. Best, Jeff",

Have Houston IT yet had the opportunity to review the IP licence agreements from a technical standpoint and do they have any questions on the wording etc of the documents for discussion with the exchange?? I believe that we may be in a position to get signature copies of these documents out of the OMLX on Friday of this week, or certainly during the early part of next week, and I would hope that we can avoid having to go back to OMLX with IT Dept's queries on the docs after they are issued for signature. 2. Neither I, nor for that matter the OMLX Legal Dept in London, believe that Merrills should have a problem under CTFC Part 30 as clearer - in fact these Rules probably don't apply at all to them as a clearer (they would if they were acting as an execution broker) - and even if the Rules were to bite, Merrills should meet the requirements by being FSA regulated in the UK (the FSA has an MOU with the CFTC on this issue). Hence we can't understand what Merrills are talking about!! I wonder if we can short-circuit this issue - if Bob still wants to go ahead with Merrills, may be Bob could put me in touch with his contact at Merrills in London and then I can involve their Legal Dept (Merrills have a competent Legal crew in London, and should be able to deal with this really quickly).

        "clean_content": "Mid Market Power Form/ENA Changes Carol: I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form. Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for your review. Please note the following as you review: 1. The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer's utility. 2. I did not include a \"Setoff\" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another agreement in place with these customers. If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so. 3. The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past). Taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a \"force majeure event\" in an effort to soften the approach (see the GTCs). Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the interest of \"saving space\" than anything else... Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched. If you are comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms. Thanks again for your help with this project, Marianne P.S. Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my \"hiatus\" -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16.

        "clean_content": " stacy white 7-15-02.PST I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management. The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets. Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices. Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis, Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations. Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams. I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes. Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner. Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron. Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.",

As we indicated, we are interested in pursuing implementing the agreement. However, we are concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable. This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the attached markup: (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and (ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the operation of cross-affiliate netting.

        "clean_content": "Consulting Agreements with lobbyists Importance: High As you know, in the last few months we have had discussions regarding the retention of lobbyists to perform services on our Florida Power Development Projects. It was decided that we would have the lobbyists retained through the Government Affairs group. Two recent agreements, one with Quantum Results and another with Tripp, Scott, provided for payments to be made at certain junctures of our development process. It has come to our attention that these payments were not timely made. In order to make sure that we don't inadvertently miss any future payments, I am proposing that: 1. We continue to retain the consultants through execution of a consulting services agreement signed by Government Affairs. The consulting agreements will be prepared in duplicate originals so that the lobbyist keeps one copy and Enron keeps one copy. 2. Legal will retain Enron's executed original and provide it to Kay Young, who maintains a database of all consulting agreements and confidentiality agreements entered into by ENA entities. 3. Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to government affairs for their records. 4. Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to Kathleen Carnahan who will set up a payment schedule. Unlike our real property option agreements that have a date certain for payment, these agreements often have payment schedules dependent upon some approval process. Thus, it will be important for all of us to keep Kathleen in the loop as to dates of hearings or approvals so that she will know if it is time for a payment. 5. Kathleen will provide notices to government affairs that a payment is due, and the amount of the payment and arrange for reimbursement of such payment out of the development group's RC. 6. Government affairs will make the payments and be reimbursed out of the development group's RC. Please advise if this system will work for you so that we can undertake to have Kathleen begin setting up a payment schedule. My strong preference is that we continue to keep things flowing through the government affairs group so that we consistently maintain the lobbyist relationship. However, this will require government affairs have some way of monitoring the agreements. I think we fix that problem with having Kathleen keep a consultant schedule just as she keeps an option schedule. I'm going on vacation as of next Wednesday so your response by Tuesday will be greatly appreciated.",

Burton has been meeting with the Speaker off and on most of the morning and even members such as Sher, whose bill will be amended with the language, has not been included. Burton is not sharing information with his staff on the status of the negotiations yet. Everyone I spoke with says either a deal is hammered out over this language or its over. As far as we can tell Republicans are out of the play altogether. On another note, a representative from CSU approached me to say they are negotiating to extend their contract with Enron but have concerns that Enron will leave the state because it won't be able to grow its business under the legislative proposal or pending PUC action. He asked us to find out what Enron's plan is under these circumstances. So, will one of you share with us what the plan is, or at least, how we respond to this question. Thanks. ",

I touched base with Susan Helton, who touched base with you and we were instructed to talk to legal (Jeff Hodge) and to Regulatory Affairs (Rick Shapiro), and so I did. They both listened to our 2002 business plan, and revised our numbers. The cost allocation for Outside Legal that Jeff Hodge (and Mark Haediecke) are proposing for Enron de Mexico, for 2002 is $133,000 USD. The cost allocation for Regulatory Affairs for the same period, proposed by Rick Shapiro, is $250,000. I hope this is OK with you, but please do not hesitate to give me a call at your convenience.

As I understand what is going on - CES has an obligation to deliver gas to International Paper through March, 2000. I agree with Colleen that CES is obligated by the terms of our agreement to purchase this gas from Enron through March, 2000. As far as the Energy Management functions, these duties are not part of the Enron Retail contract. The real problem that has arisen with International Paper is that they have some ill feelings towards Enron for some reason. We have attempted to smooth this over but it appears that the gentleman at International Paper has a big burr in his saddle that I nor anyone at CES can remove. International Paper refuses to execute any paperwork required by the pipelines to allow Enron to nominate gas. Since this is such a short term deal, I would recommend that a CES transition employee nominate the gas and work out the logistics with Enron to get the gas to International Paper and keep them happy. Whatever CES and Enron need to do from an accounting standpoint to make sure Enron is made whole can be handled fairly easily I would assume. As far as business after March, 2000, International Paper has no obligation to purchase gas from CES. So if they do not purchase gas from CES, then Enron will not be affected after March 2000. If International Paper does execute an extension to their gas purchase agreement or enter into a new purchase agreement then we will definitely need to get this agency problem worked out. Please feel free to call me at 713-693-2552 should any of you have any questions regarding the foregoing. Thank you. Kendrick",

As you know, Sally Beck has requested that I conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current pay arrangements for all Energy Operations staff. The purpose of this analysis will be to ensure that the department's current pay arrangements are in line with the competitive marketplace. Each component of pay will be examined individually and within the context of Enron's compensation philosophy (e.g., base salary, bonus, long-term incentives and total compensation). The process will begin with a series of interviews which will be conducted in two stages: Stage 1-Data Gathering: the focus of this stage will be upon gathering data around your perceptions of your group's current pay arrangements and give you the opportunity to address any of the internal and external inequities you perceive to exist. Stage 2-Job Matching: the focus of this stage will be on job matching - we will establish a mutually agreed upon time to meet and discuss which positions in our salary surveys most accurately reflect the roles and responsibilities of your staff. We will not be able to match 100 percent of your jobs to the jobs contained in the salary surveys. Non-benchmark jobs will be reviewed using a job \"slotting\" approach. To help facilitate the matching process, I will be assembling handouts containing the job descriptions taken from the relevant salary surveys which I will send to each of you in advance of our Stage 2 meeting. The intent here is to give you the opportunity to \"pre-match\" your respective jobs thereby minimizing the time required to achieve this objective during our Stage 2 meeting. It will be critical that you are comfortable with the matches that you agree to as these matches will be used when gathering relevant market data. The data will only be as good as the matches. Following the conclusion of Stage 2, I can begin gathering the market data based on the results of the job matching exercise and prepare a comparative analysis that I will be presenting to Sally Beck. I will be contacting each of you in the next few days to set up the Stage 1 interviews. I look forward to working with each of you and to the successful completion of this project.

        "clean_content": " PYBARBO (Non-Privileged).pst As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

The modification renames the \"Counterparty\" to be a \"User\" and provides that the \"Other Agreements\" are modified only if both the User and the counterparty to those Other Agreements have agreed to use the Website and Modules (e.g., by agreeing to the ESA and Annex documents). I want to do a bit more thinking about the viability of the amendment mechanism - an ESA with each counterparty to an Other Agreement - before we finalize this and whether or not there is a different and/or better way to accomplish this task. But, in the interest of time and your schedule, I wanted you to see this for your review and thoughts. If you and Tom would be comfortable with the concept of \"User\" vs. \"Counterparty\", this would require a change to the terminology of the Password Application and all Annex documents.

        "clean_content": " lcampbe.nsf This year has been a year of change for Enron and GPG: Enron's stock split, we implemented a Continuous Improvement program, and we underwent a major reorganization. These changes have all had a positive impact on our company, increasing our competitive advantage in the marketplace and challenging a well performing organization to perform at an even higher level. All of this translates to raising the bar for increased performance. As GPG begins its annual year-end process of appraising performance and allocating variable pay and merit increases, there are a number of changes to the process I would like to communicate. These changes will impact all GPG employees, except those of you receiving Skill Based Pay. These changes will help us take a more focused look at individual and overall company performance and are intended to ensure consistency and equity in the process across GPG. The following details these changes: Vice Presidents and Higher All employees with the title of vice president or higher will be reviewed Enron-wide, using common performance criteria and performance ratings. The officers will be reviewed and ranked within peer groups. These groups are Commercial, Commercial Support, Commercial Support Specialist and Technical. All Other Non-Skill Based Pay Employees All other non-Skill Based Pay employees will be evaluated using the current GPG performance criteria and performance levels within their respective company or business unit. This will not be an Enron-wide activity. For directors or director-equivalent employees there will be an additional step, which will be a GPG-wide cross-calibration by the GPG Management Committee in early December. We are taking a more focused look at performance. In our efforts to challenge a well-performing organization to achieve an even higher level of performance, we are establishing the following distribution as a guideline: Level 1 - Consistently Exceeds Expectations 10% Level 2 - Often Exceeds Expectations 30% Level 3 - Meets Expectations 50% Level 4 - Needs Improvement and Level 5 - Seldom Meets Expectations 10% In the case of non-Skill Based Pay team employees in Operations, this process will lead to two ratings: a team rating, which will determine the level of variable pay, and an individual rating that will be used to determine merit increases. This represents a change in our performance management process. GPG is the premier natural gas transmission company because of our ability to accept and demand change. We were one of the first companies to implement a Skill Based Pay Program and self-directed work teams. We implemented Best Practices and Continuous Improvement. This new approach to performance management is an effort to strive for the top level of performance in our industry. I want to be clear that we have raised our performance expectations for the company as well as for individuals. Variable pay and merit increases will be impacted by these changes as well. GPG will use market data, job grade and individual and company performance to set target bonus payout levels. Payouts will reflect performance. Division heads will no longer receive a pool of dollars to allocate to their employees. This method will eliminate significant differences in variable pay for similar positions, job levels and performance levels across the organization. Merit increases will continue to be determined as they were in the past. Each business unit will have a pool of dollars, which is funded as a percent of payroll. Merit increases will be based on a variety of factors including individual performance. Variable pay will be distributed in early February and merit increases are effective Feb. 1, 2000. To continue to be a leading energy transportation company in a highly competitive market, it is imperative that we continue to strive for excellence in all we do. I appreciate your continued support as we go through this change, as you have accepted and supported other changes we have undergone. Please do not hesitate to call your supervisor or your Human Resources Representative if you have any questions.",

One new risk is the upcoming cold spell and very high Northwest prices. This will cost us a lot of money, possibly not recoverable from customers, and may spread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest. This could develop as a risk to the Sierra sale in the extreme, but right now appears manageble. More on this as it develops.

Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer). Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron. The laundry list of topics discussed is attached. We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO. We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process. However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this. We will try to get others to sign on to the comments. Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included: ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript). Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time). Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining). All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes. Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future. This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us. Ray ",

        "clean_content": "Enron Energia Induistrial de Mexico Dear Peggy: In furtherance to our telephone conversation, please find below brief analysis of the amparo claim submitted by Consorcio Desarrollo Economico Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. (\"Consorcio\")which you have the concern may affect the standing of permits granted to Enron Energia Induistrial de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (\"Enron\"). The main arguments presented by Consorcio in its amparo complaint seeks to challenge the constitutionality of certain legislation, including regulations under which permits are granted for generation of electricity. ?Further, Consorcio challenges the actions of the Energy Regulatory (Commission Comision Reguladora de Energia) insofar as it granted a permit to Enron and other entities, despite the fact that Consorcio had submitted an application earlier in 1999. ?The challenge is also directed against action of the Federal Electricity Commission (Comision Federal de Electricidad) and Luz y Fuerza del Centro, for executing a Supply Agreement with the permit holders. The claim of amparo is in our belief deficient, and so is their initial request to be granted a suspension of effects during the judicial process. It is important to point out that the amparo claim is filed against laws and actions of authorities, and not against private entities or actions of private entities. From the documents reviewed, Enron filed a brief as third interested party affected (tercero perjudicado) whereby it essentially presented the argument that Consorcio could not avail itself of the protection of amparo, to the extent that it had already consented to the validity of regulations at the time it filed itself for an application to be awarded a permit for generation of electric energy. In its ruling of September 29th 2000, the Second District Court for Administrative Matters for the Federal District rejected the claim for procedural grounds (sobreseimiento), withouit examining the merits of the claim, insofar as it determined that there were several causes therefor, including, but not limited to the fact that the claim against certain authorities was inapplicable. ?It also indicated that the nature of the permits executed by the Energy Regulatory Commission should be deemed as actions among private entities. ?We believe this last aspect is incorrect, although we believe there were ample causes for denial of the amparo, even though the District Court did not examine the merits of the complaint. The District Court did not therefore consider the arguments submitted on behalf of Enron. Consorcio thereafter appealed through a procedure of review (recurso de revisi?n), challenging that the District Court failed to identify CFE and Luz y Fuerza del Centro as authorities, even though they had powers enacted as authorities. ?It did not, however, address the issue outlined by the District Court on whether the permits were of a private nature. Enron filed through its local counsel a new brief identifying the failure by Consorcio to identify actions which affect its rights as required under Mexican Amparo Law, while it insisted on the fact that Consorcio had consented to the law. In light of the above, we believe there are scarse opportunities for the appeal (revisi?n) to be successful, because even though the Collegiate Circuit Court were to deem that the District Court failed to examine certain issues and decided to examine the merits of the claim, the arguments and purported legal rights affected which were claimed by Consorcio should not be deemed to be valid. If you would like any clarification to the above, we will gladly oblige.

        "clean_content": " sscott3.nsf In Mark Baldwin's June 19 letter, he proposed the following fee schedule for project development: Retainer: $1000/month plus expenses Accepted project (meets TW's predetermined financial hurdles): Proposal $5000 Each month TW actively negotiating project: $1500/month (each project) Letter of Intent: $5000 Signed Agreement: $10,000 Incentive Fee: To be determined When I spoke with Mark, he explained that this schedule was based on reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects. In his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) and market development services (including SoCal OIR related services -- $3000/mo.). This e-mail addresses the project development fee structure only. The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and third party \"identified by IGS under this agreement.\" As you know, the \"identified by\" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the Southern Energy Gallup Expansion contract, in which both IGS and the TW Commercial Group worked on the deal. Fortunately, the ambiguity worked to Transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in ongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any future consulting agreement. Mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides for payment on a per-project basis. This immediately eliminates the \"identified by\" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on. I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling agreement. If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the specific project, as needed). For each project, we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement. I've outlined the agreement below as a starting point for discussion. The numbers are Mark's; we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate. I've omitted any payment for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent are of little value to Transwestern. Call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to proceed. From time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, IGS may present brief, preliminary project proposals to Transwestern. If Transwestern desires IGS's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so notify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the following terms and conditions: 1. Retainer for project development: $1000/month plus expenses. Project development shall include but not be limited to: research, due diligence, market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically authorized by Transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of Transwestern as requested by Transwestern, and preparing a detailed written proposal. Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other project-specific requirements. Transwestern shall continue to pay the retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the counterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to terminate the project. 2. If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS's written proposal (or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay IGS a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the project]. \"Accepting the project\" means that the project meets Transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern Commercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the project to completion. Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this paragraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to completion. 3. If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the project, it shall pay IGS $10,000. Additionally, the parties may negotiate an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset of the project). (I will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.). ",

Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response: 1) Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity. 2) If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation? 3) What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger? Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated! Thanks, Jim",

Corporate Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a \"Workflow\" system to route invoice images for approval and processing. This workflow solution will not be implemented until early 2001. In the interim, an approval process will be implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and correct general ledger coding. Effective Monday, November 20 the following approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater: (A) Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two approvals: a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting Director approval of the general ledger coding. (B) Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an Accounting Director approval of the payment and general ledger coding. In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached. If not attached, then the payment will not be processed. To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting Directors in your business unit using the attached form. Please forward this information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th. This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th. It important to provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be processed. ",

        "clean_content": "Revised: Organizational Changes To: Enron North America Corp. From: Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets, and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce the following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA. 1) Coverage/Origination: To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service companies and IPP's; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries. Downstream Coverage/Origination As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear that the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp. Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp. Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENA's existing energy commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also EES's energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel's chemicals, plastics and refined products risk management capability. These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg's leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering: a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision of paper risk management products; b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries; c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers Trust's global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to leadthe coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing industries. Midstream Coverage/Origination a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group' activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect. We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of this group; b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. They will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring opportunities in the Western U.S. We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination efforts; c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio's of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group. In addition, Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect; d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructuring opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets. We have asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair, formerly of Enron Asia's development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join this newly formed business. 2) Commercial Transactions: The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA's efficiency in executing transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage. CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management. The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership, execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups. This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions: a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western Coverage/Origination Groups. The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy Lemmons joined Enron in 1992. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA's industrial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining, Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established. The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich. We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups. The senior members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud and John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix. We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups. The senior members of this team include Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert. We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend. Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams. Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group. The remaining four groups within CTG will remain largely unchanged. In addition, the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together. We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ENA's markets particularly in the industrial markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups. Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in North America by working with us to implement these changes. ",

I have tried to incorporate some additional provisions and inserted a few \"place-savers\" to mark some areas where we need to discuss the agreement further; for instance, under what circumstances has a party \"defaulted\" -- and should at least be liable for the other party's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in establishing the interfaces as well as give the other party the right to terminate the agreement -- and under what circumstances should either party be able to walk away (such as, it just doesn't work)? Many of these provisions will be \"fleshed out\" more when the technical considerations are added, and when we sit down with the counterparty to negotiate this Agreement. Hopefully the attached gives you something to meet with S&C on Wednesday. Again, I can participate by phone if any of you think it would be helpful.

She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale Agreement, to wit: 1). They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows: Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless buyer for the same. Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding authority to do so. I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor revisions which I will do. 2). They are concerned about the warranty language which covers hazardous wastes in ? 4. They tell me that they have not done an environmental inspection of the property. They want to know if there have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on the property. They are looking for something in writing that no such sources existed. 3). Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31, 1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to Louisiana Resources Co., Inc. Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc. I have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy. 4). She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents. Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns. Keith",

If they don't hear from us they intend tofile a motion with the bankruptcy court. Thus far, they have not done so because we have been discussing a resolution of the issues with them for the last few weeks. That said, the letter will be sent only if it is consistent with the final cmmercial call by Ed McMichael. Paying producers for deliveredgas is ordinary course (per Mark E) but Ed is contemplating a BTRC review anyway. If the commercial group decides not to pay DRI, this letter would be revised to state that fact. I can reference the gas purchase and sale agreement, there is only one such agreement between the parties. The price is set forth in the agreement. The purpose of the letter is to show DRI that we are not stringing them along with requests that they not file in court, and no intention of paying them. Trainor just wants something to give his client comfort that he is not being suckered. Shemin V.

This letter will be sent to all directors of the Company. The accounts for this Company were due to be filed at the end of February 2001. Unfortunately a filing extension request (form 244) was never filed and the accounts must now be filed by 3 December at the latest to avoid penalties being incurred. The April accounts require a Letter of Comfort to be supplied from Enron, and in the current situation this will not be possible within the timescale for filing. (The Letter of Comfort is required as the Company requires inter-company loans to remain in place for the Company to remain solvent). To solve this problem, the Balance Sheet of TME Engineers Limited is being restructured to ensure the directors can sign on a going concern basis, and this will be arranged within the next few days. Peter Pentecost will be calling each of you over the next couple of days to explain the background to the problem more fully and to outline the solution/answer any questions you may have. In case for any reason the restructure of the Balance Sheet cannot be completed by the 3 December deadline, we are agreeing with Arthur Andersen an alternative basis for the audit opinion to be signed, such that the Accounts can still be signed off and submitted by the Directors in time. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this issue, please contact Brian Muscroft on 0044 207 783 2703.

        "clean_content": "MG plc and Rudolph Wolfe 07:33 PM Hi, Jane! I talked to Ingrid Krinke again today. Ingrid is the HR person at MG MCC, the New York branch of MG plc. MG plc has acquired Rudolph Wolff, another British company. Rudolph wolfe has the two H1 and one L1 visa employees. It turns out that MG plc is doing an asset acquisition of Rudolph Wolff, not a stock transfer, and Ingrid's immigration attorney tells her that they cannot transfer an L1 in an asset transfer. Ingrid is starting the process of transferring the H1's from RW to MG. I do not know how much ingrid knows about visas, and it would probably be good if we guided her so that she does not so something that impacts us or that is unnecessary. Ingrid has a thick file of immigration \"stuff\" on these folks but she does not know what to send to us. Could you give her a call and talk to her about the situation? I am concerned that i am not asking her the right questions, or I may garble the info when I pass it on to you. Ingrid is at 212.715.5241. I told her that you might call. closing is forecast for Sept. 8; i may be in NY either this monday or the following monday collecting data. I would be happy to sit with you and tell you what I know , or join in on the call to ingrid.

At the suggestion of Ron Nolte of the ENA IT group, it would be easiest if we could create a variable which would populate non-EOL deals with the language in question thus leaving EOL deals pristine.

The majority of our comments, as you will note, are intended to clarify the understanding of the parties with respect to the various matters set forth in such documents and are not intended to \"change the deal\". Except that, upon the advise of our tax counsel, we have adjusted the amounts of the promissory notes to be issued in connection with the transaction in order to maximize the LLC's basis in the Turbines. We believe this is consistent with your initial draft of the Letter Agreement. Also, please note that we have included additional language in Section 6 of the Letter Agreement which provides NorthWestern with the opportunity to consult with GE on matters relating to the Turbines. This reflects our understanding of an agreement that had been reached among the parties. With respect to the LLC Agreement, we would like to discuss with you the following: (i) the timing of the exercise of the Call Right and (ii) the intent of your proposed language in Section 7 relating to the rights of each Member to act in its own best interests with respect to the Call and Put Rights.

Jeff will also retain his duties as president and chief operating officer. I will continue as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations. Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth. He is clearly ready for the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I'm ready for a somewhat different role. Our succession plan has been clear for some time. This has afforded Jeff and me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that continues to exceed everyone's expectations, including our own. We look forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role. There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad shifts in strategy and direction.

        "clean_content": "Here it is guys including the new text in blue. Stella Chan and Pat Keene are currently streamlining the process of providing Government and Regulatory support to URM (Utility Risk Management) to include: Curve validation Process, Quantifying of Regulatory Risks/Change, Coordination of Strategy Development, and Coordination of Strategy Implementation. A description of these functions are as follows: Curve Validation Process: This process aims at reviewing, and validating, every 90 days, the regulatory inputs of: a) the largest 60 curves in Enron's books, and b) the new deals that are under approval during the review period. The curve validation process is currently in progress and GA personnel in Houston and the regions are already involved. Quantification of Regulatory Risks/Change: This process aims at quantifying dollars terms--the impact of the change in the regulatory inputs on a specific position. The model is now in place, and test is in progress. This process will involve initiation by GA regional personnel (also possibly by URM) with potential regulatory changes that may impact EES positions. The quantification exercise will be done jointly by URM and GA. Coordination of Strategy Development: The outcome of curve validation and quantification of regulatory risks--functions 1, and 2 above--will likely call for a group of regulatory measures and action items. The function of Stella and Pat is to coordinate and facilitate strategy sessions in association with the owner of the curve in URM, and her/his counterparts in Midwest/Midsouth, Atlantic Seaboard, the Western Region, and Texas & Oklahoma Ercot, and SPP. The strategy sessions shall come up with suggested action items, probability of success, and likely associate costs for implementation. Stella and Pat shall be responsible for seeking the buy-off, and approval, of the strategy from URM and securing the needed budget, if necessary. Coordination of Strategy Implementation: Once the strategy is approved, it shall enter the implementation stage. The role of Stella and Pat is to coordinate between URM requests/positions and their counterparts in the regions. As the case now, they shall continue supporting the regions in the implementation as needed. To facilitate these functions Stella and Pat shall emulate the coverage lines of the URM. Stella shall coordinate the Eastern Region, while Pat shall coordinate the Western Region. These regions do not follow the conventional wisdom, and need to be specifically defined. They are: Eastern Region: ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, NJ, PA, MD, DE, VA, WV, NC, SC, GA, AL, TE, KY, and FL. Western Region: The remaining states (including OH in the east). From the Regional perspective, the process will naturally be overseen by the Regional Managers (i.e., Steve, Janine, Jean, and Paul), meanwhile, Harry shall oversee it from Houston side. The process, however, is designed to be as autonomous as possible and shall make the least possible demand on the time and work load of the regional managers (usually in the final sprint for approvals). Stella, Pat, and Harry shall visit you shortly to discuss the details of the processes outlined above and listen to your comments and advise. ",

        "clean_content": "CPUC Decision Suspending Direct Access The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the business team on the DA suspension issue. All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision). Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and all DASRs to initiate DA service to the appropriate Utility no later than June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to ensure DA service. New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday). DASRs for these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001. The July 6 date is our estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts. It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract execution timing. Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the Utility per the tariff process. Once the customer has been returned to Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe. In addition, returning to Utility service may incur a \"re-entry fee\". Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions. These amendments should be signed prior to June 30, 2001. It is possible that the CPUC will require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers. One additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the Negative CTC credit). We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in number to follow). Jim ",

        "clean_content": " emclaug.nsf With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about the PRC process. First some context: The key to Enron's success is the increasing quality and dedication of our talent. As we continue to attract and retain the very best people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the organization. At the core of our system are the following principles: ? Hire the best people. ? Provide challenging opportunities. ? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not entitlement). ? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process. ? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees. The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system. The PRC is built on this foundation: ? 360 degree performance feedback. ? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor. ? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions and to allocate bonus money. In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understand the following details: ? Relative ranking. Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excellent=018, =01&strong=018, \"satisfactory\", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=018 to group all employees. This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of these descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers. It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current period if other employees' performance raised the bar. ? Teamwork. A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee to gain, others must suffer. However, feedback is explicitly solicited on teamwork when evaluating each individual's performance. Anyone who attempts to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others in the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance criterion. ? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistently captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30% strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance or are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informed discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflects their groups' overall effectiveness and need for improvement. ? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below should know his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above. In all cases, employees will receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of success, and areas that need improvement. We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process. We would like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going forward. Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, and there will be other methods we will create to let us know what you think. In the meantime, please feel free to consult with your HR Generalist if you have any immediate questions, comments, or concerns.",

Below find comments/notes - Brad mentioned his concern about turnover of O&M staff with Duane's departure. Responded that we had a capable plant manager with 10 years plant experience plus key people at the lower levels had remained. Also told Brad that the two I&C consultants we have had since the outset of the project are still working at the facility and that we were taking on 6 technicans from Siemens during combined cycle start-up. Brad seemed okay with the response. Discussed two key contractual issues - TAA - They expressed the importance of keeping the TAA in place with no dilution since it is so important to the lenders. Furthermore they mentioned that SCC's position is Siemens will come after us to dilute the TAA and that in fact it is no longer valid. (I agree Siemens will come after us for the risk profile modification) Responded that we felt that the TAA was still valid and mentioned that Siemens might want the TAA to commence at completion on oil. Sue's commented that we need to calculate how much it would cost us to keep the start date at Substantial Completion on fuel. Phase II - Explained that given the current commissioning program that we had no intention of lowering the dampners and testing for simple cycle Phase II on gas. They are on board with this concept. We just need to get a white paper to them to explain in detail. Drilling - The comment was the formations are tough but will get there slowly but surely. Using 1 May as gas available at the plant date. Change Orders - Transmitted SCCs frustration on little movement on change orders related to the pipeline. Told them that many of the change orders still without documents and in any case the strategy was to settle up at the end of the job. Brad and Sue mentioned that they would feel more comfortable with the process and putting a number on the value of the change orders if we were closer to resolution. worried about the size of the change orders - especially the outside case. have not given this to the banks there outside change order case is as follows - Power Plant Pipeline Total Total EPC US$ 419 mm Approved Change Orders 22 mm Pending Change Orders US$ 10 mm US$ 25 mm 35 mm Cont Change Orders 8 mm 24 mm 32 mm Hope this information is useful. rgds Laine ",

Enron's preference would be to use these master instead of the GISB agreements for the firm deals. The Firm GTC were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these Masters in place. I did review the GISB we currently have in place with Northern States Power (WI and MN). These agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached Master. These Masters should address the specific concerns included in your email. 1. The Masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the GISB does. 2. The netting issue we need to address. The GISB don't have netting provisions, but we don't use GISB for any firm deals over 1 month in term. I am not sure I understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting. These Master contain netting provisions. Let's discuss once you have reviewed the Masters. 3. Force Majeure provisions are similar to the GTC. Enron prefers a vary narrow definition of FM. We modify the GISB FM to reflect this with special provisions. If you could provide specific comments we can address your issues. 4. Audit provisions are included in the Masters. 5. Any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this Master. If you could provide specific language we can address this issue.

You willbe able to prepare your expense report, send it for approval, and transmit it for payment using the Intranet. It will be far more user-friendly than the Excel-based form currently in use and will provide a truly paperless process. In addition, the system efficiently integrates with the SAP accounting system. On October 16, employees who used a prior version of the product upgraded to the most current release. On October 30, it will be available to Enron Corp employees, Company 0011. The rollout to other groups will continue through January 2001. Rollout announcements will be made to each business unit. In Houston, IT Central will provide four training sessions per week. To enroll in a class go to itcentral.enron.com and click on Services>Training>Schedules. Those in outlying locations and those who prefer on-line training can use LEAP by signing on to sap.enron.com and clicking on Training, then LEAP. Use xms (lower case) as the User ID and Password.

Also Troy Denetsosie is preparing a work flow document to chart the gas nomination and sales process for both the NNG and TW gas. The February gas was nominated for both NNG and TW this week and Troy will be doucmenting the procedures for getting this gas scheduled, priced, sold, invoiced, and booked. Once this is complete, I will be scheduling an update meeting with everyone to review this. We can also review the rebate calculations and any other topics. In addition I am still working on the Enron Compression LLC financials. I have found booking errors on the ledger that need to be corrected as well as accruals and other entries that are need to be booked. Ana, I will be sending you an email summarzing these.

Who is impacted? Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables. Invoices entered directly into SAP, will not be impacted by this process. Note: Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved (again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. How do I receive training? Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>. Note: You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view these materials.

        "clean_content": " matt motley 6-26-02.pst We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status. As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22. We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month. We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave. We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed. We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed. The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns. The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan. Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy. These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate. The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process. To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee. We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible. This is currently our top priority, bar none! When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be. Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place. We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation. The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved. That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse. We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan. We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court. We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court. With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future. In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week. And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible. ",

We recognize that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron's business goals, and we are pleased that many of you have shared in the company's financial success through Enron stock options. As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program. Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron's continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package. On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program). It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, is as follows: ? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations. ? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.) ? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000. ? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant of stock options. Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program, among other good reasons=01( that's why. In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your questions, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your Human Resources representative. Note: In addition to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, granting of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron companies' employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refine the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

He relayed some additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which include the following: 1. The price agreed upon is $90,000. 2. D-G will provide system support. 3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide the source code to Enron. In the meantime, the source code is to be in escrow. Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12 months if any of the following conditions occur: (i) D-G goes out of business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (iii) if D-G agrees to release it sooner. Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to discuss the escrow situation. Vince mentioned that you had suggested that your attorney keep the software in escrow. Is your attorney a U.S. attorney? It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney. Is that the same person? Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo practitioner? Basically, if you could just provides some additional information about your attorney, I would appreciate it. We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow. We have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology. I will check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney. Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow, we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to you for your review.

        "clean_content": " plove.nsf It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen. We recognize that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron's business goals, and we are pleased that many of you have shared in the company's financial success through Enron stock options. As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program. Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron's continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package. On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program). It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, is as follows: ? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations. ? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.) ? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000. ? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant of stock options. Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program, among other good reasons=01( that's why. In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your questions, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your Human Resources representative. Note: In addition to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, granting of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron companies' employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refine the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

A few points: as I read the contract, client is paying for the insurance cost of BCCKOP, and therefore should get full benefit of those policies, not just limited to claims attributable to BCCKOP's gross negligence/willful misconduct. BCCKOP is in full control of the Facility and therefore should wear some financial risk for damage to it arising out of the Operating Services. I have limited this to $100k per occurrence (our deductible for non-power gen assets is $1MM). I've also made them take deductibles under their policies for third party liability and employee injury risks (they had these on us originally), and specified that their GL cover include pollution legal liability (they had this on us also, but since it's a third party risk I think it should stay with the operator). Call me if I've got this wrong or if we need to discuss further. Thx, David 3-6847 ",

There are deals which were \"closed\" last year (\"closing\" meaning that price, MWh volume, term, power profile, center of gravity etc were agreed upon between the contracting entities). Some of these MWh's have already been physically traded but MAE haven't yet calculated the system's settlement. Karla and I are currently working on the below listed deals: Moema-2: 10-year PPA to purchase 8MW; PV of apprx US$5,130,000.; MTM value of US$1,200,000. Sgu?rio: 2-year PPA to purchase 0.5MW; TBD Furnas Collar: 2-year PPA to purchase 20-90-130MW (collar concept); PV of apprx US$37,696,000.; MTM value of US$12,534,000. Cofepar: 15-year term to purchase 200MW; PV of apprx US$171,014,000.; MTM to be defined. CSN: 14-month PPA to purchase 13.4MW (10,000MWh/month); PV of apprx US$5,865,000.; MTM value of US$786,000.

AES Sul: 4-month PPA to purchase 33,6MW; PV of apprx US$2,470,000.; MTM value of US$866,000. We are not (yet) working under \"umbrella\" type of agreements where Enron and the counterparty will execute a General Terms and Conditions (GTC) with several Annexes, each of them related to a specific deal. Each contract is to be treated as one single deal. Some of the above listed deals are 1QTR commercial priorities and I need to know if you would be OK with Enron's Marketing Co (ECE) using ICC-administered or FIESP-administered (as a second alternative) arbitration under ICC Rules in S?o Paulo as the PPA's dispute resolution mechanism. Although I am schedule to meet with Tozzini, Freire this week, I doubt I will have time to get their legal opinion, discuss it internally, prepare a recommendation to Jim Derrick etc etc. I've already talked to some of the counterparty's in-house counsellors and none of them is willing to accept offshore arbitration. Our counterparties' position has been arbitration in Brazil under int'l rules OR local courts. Rgds, Sami ",

Xi Xi ----------------------------------------------------------- 02 November 2000 ?? Enron Broadband Services (EBS) has announced plans to enter Japan's telecoms market with a variety of broadband-related services scheduled to start within the next three years. The announcement came at the launch of its wholly-owned subsidiary in Tokyo, Enron Japan Corp., where Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive officer of U.S.-based energy giant Enron Corp., spelled out the company's plans for Japan. Enron is to offer its clients, including other service providers and corporates, a broadband fibre optic network - a backbone infrastructure for network-based video content distribution - and the leasing of bandwidth on high-capacity telecoms circuits, amongst other services, he said. The company plans to have its Japanese fiber-optic network in place within the next two or three years. =01&Japan is a large and technologically advanced market, and we believe the opportunities for our business here are tremendous,=018 said Ken Rice, chairman and chief executive of Enron Broadband Services. =01&We look forward to developing mutually beneficial relationships with content providers and distribution partners in Japan. This will extend our global reach and provide our Japanese partners with the opportunity to give their customers the highest quality Internet experience.=018 EBS recently announced an agreement with i2, a U.S. electronic software developer, to provide bandwidth capacity to meet its international networking needs, including linking i2's Dallas headquarters with its Tokyo location. In addition, EBS is developing a pooling point in Tokyo, which will facilitate the buying and selling of bandwidth between Japan and the U.S. The company also said it hoped to eventually supply Japan with the same video-on-demand service planned for the U.S., which it is developing with video rental store chain Blockbuster Inc. As a first step to competing in Japan, Enron must find a Japanese affiliate to obtain a Type 1 telecoms carrier license. ",

I have added some language to your proposals, but have kept the intention intact. The only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require (a) a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by Natsource will be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee letter) and (b) if an LC has already been posted, it will need to be modified so that it will reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it for Natsource-Tullet. If no LC has been issued, this latter point will need to be handled in any LC issued. Please take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further. I will be checking with our personnel to confirm that Natsource LLC does not have to be a signatory to this BETA.

We believe this is consistent with your initial draft of the Letter Agreement. Also, please note that we have included additional language in Section 6 of the Letter Agreement which provides NorthWestern with the opportunity to consult with GE on matters relating to the Turbines. This reflects our understanding of an agreement that had been reached among the parties.

In order for us to focus on the value/commercial issues surrounding the sites in Com-Ed, we need to get the ball in motion on the site sale release from PERC first. This should be a brief - but binding - letter agreement which includes the following points: PERC is hereby authorizing ENA to solicit interests in the Calumet and Torrence sites for the purpose of sale, joint venture, development, or other transactions. ENA will have the sole and exclusive authority to determine whether or not to commit the site(s) to such a commercial transaction, and PERC shall have the right - but not the obligation - to participate in said transaction on an equal ownership basis with ENA. In the event that PERC does not elect to participate in said transaction, ENA shall have the right to undertake such a transaction to the exclusion of PERC, provided that ENA pays PERC the following exercise prices for the site(s) in question: Calumet price $1,000,000. Torrence price $100,000. Said exercise price shall be the sole and total compensation for PERC should they elect not to participate in said transaction as proposed by ENA. PERC shall have __ days to give formal written notice of its intent to participate in such transaction from the date of notice by ENA. If PERC elects to participate with ENA on said transaction(s), ENA and PERC will share equally in any proceeds thereof, however, no exercise price shall be payable if PERC elects to participate with ENA. The term of this authorization shall be for 90 days from the date of execution and 10 days evergreen thereafter unless cancelled by either party by two days written notice. This agreement is binding on the parties hereto, provided however, that it shall be conditioned upon PERC and Enron (or an affiliate or agent thereof) executing a mutually agreeable document to effect the transfer of ownership of their turbines for a purchase price of $56,000,000. The next item we will need is a authorization document allowing us (Enron Canada/ENA) to negotiate with ABB for changes needed in the ABB contract.",

For EOTT, we want to pursue acquisitions of energy assets period.. We do not need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business. In fact a portfolio of assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices. Second, we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices. Therefore, fee based business structures are the best fit. That would include pipeline acquisitions (crude, liquid, natural gas, CO2, etc) as well as fee based processing. Non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok as long as they are fee based-type deals 9IE..electric generation). Terminals are also an excellent acquistion for MLP,s.

I will try to get Tim Belden's read on whether my insert is important or not to include but I would appreciate your feedback too. Re: EPSA's draft: It is very good. My only comment is that, beginnign on p. 3, EPSA should more directly attack the concept of economic witholding. There really is no such thing (or it really is not different that physical witholding). If you raise your price above the opportunity cost in the market, your buyer will go to that other resource and thus you won't be able to economically withold. Re: WPTF, I am not sure what to say. I apologize that I had not read carefully before our 1 pm call but the version I reviewed has some issues. I just don't think it will be received that well by the FERC staff. Other than amplifying the credit issue (probably in there at Sue's request) I am hard pressed to know why Enron would support it seperate from EPSA. Alan Comnes",

Each transaction involves a sale of either Physical Metal or Warrants to the bank with Enron receiving an associated call option. The bank hedges its market risk through a complimentary foward sale with the LME. The new physical metal facility will start receiving its first trades this week. The transaction achieves much for Enron: Deconsolidation of approximately $2bn of debt financed inventory which came with the aquisition of MG plc; The creation of new capacity to grow the business beyond its existing base; Committed facilities for the business unit which are at a lower cost than the original debt financed facilities; The creation of an additional $2.15 bn capacity in the bank markets as the facilities extinguish up to 20 lines of existing credit in the banks market; A clearer reporting and control structure for the funding of Enron Metals.; A repeatable low cost structure which meets all tax and accounting tests for applications across all our business lines Congratulations to the deal team on this great effort EGF Bill Appleby, Anne Edgley Enron Metals David Tregar; John Lunzer; Howard Carter; Clive Hutchings; William Sell Legal Justin Boyd TransSupport / Acctg Melissa Allen; Phillip Lord Tax Janine Juggins; Catharina Clabots; Angela Brown ",

This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years. These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year. Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues. They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do \"reality checks\", create a \"rallying point\" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the \"same page\" about where Enron is going---and why. We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business. We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year. We currently have a session planned for: Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work: ? Each session will have approximately 25 participants. ? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue. ? This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations. ? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions. ? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum. ? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc. Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same. We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum. The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums. Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend. For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman. Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com). Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806. Thank you. ",

With this in mind, the CACS form has had further minor changes made to it and is to be found at: S:\\legal\\CACS form. Please ensure you use the form at this location at all times henceforth. Do not save it into your own directories, as further changes will be put through on this form only in future. No changes are to be made to this form please (in particular to the named signatories) without my agreement. Please read the notes on the second page of the CACS form and then adhere to the process set out there. This is particularly important because many of the commercial teams are not reading these and then appear to be getting differing explanations of the process from us. Some of the support units in particular are unhappy that A1 is not being complied with, leaving them with inadequate time to review contracts. I am always happy to improve the form, especially if it simplifies, so suggestions are welcome. Two things which will happen are: - adapted forms of the CACS will be produced for EES, Enron Global Markets and (until divested) Enron Wind. In the meantime if lawyers working on transactions within those divisions believe the proforma CACS needs to be changed to accomodate the needs of those divisions, please let me know. Mary Nell: I believe that EBS already has its own independent contract sign off process. Let me know if that is not correct. - the CACS system will be automated - probably on the workflow system as per the new billing system. The idea is that at the earliest opportunity in the life of a contract, the CACS relating to that contract is put on the system which automatically alerts signatories that they should be looking out for drafts. Draft contracts will be able to be circulated through the system. The signing process will also be simplified. Thanks for your attention. Mark ",

The transaction is for the applicable hours as set forth herein on each Delivery Day for the Effective Date 01 Oct 2001 to the Termination Date 31 Oct2001. The Contract Price for the Second Transaction in this short description will be the midpoint of the bid and offer price(s) on the Website for the second product listed in the short description at the time of the Transaction if both the bid and offer prices are then available or the available price if only one of such prices is then available. The Contract Price for the First Transaction will be the Contract Price used for the Second Transaction, modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty on the Website. The Spread Transaction shall mean the ERCOT Transaction together with the ERCOT N 2001Transaction. The Spread Seller and the Spread Buyer agree that the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction shall be treated as separate transactions under any applicable agreement(s) governing such transactions. Accordingly, for example, if a party fails to perform under the ERCOT Transaction, the other party is not excused from performance under the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction based on such non-performance.

If such North 2001 Zone is superceded by a zone or zones of different boundaries, Seller shall nevertheless be required, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, to deliver the energy to points within the geographical area coextensive with the originally defined North 2001 Zone. If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOTProtocols) operated at or above 138kV. The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.

Also, several new businesses have been created recently by consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a huge untapped market in aggregating HR services. Recently, we completed an internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and have decided to explore some very specific external opportunities. Due to the time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning dedicated resources to this effort. Effective immediately, the HR community will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order to optimize HR transformation and commercialization. Taking the lead roles will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart). ? I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities. Reporting to me on this commercialization effort will be: Brad Coleman with the overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as PEP, Expertfinder and Global Compensation; Sarah Davis who will focus on Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barrow who will focus on Benefits and Wellness; and Yevgeny Frolov and Dan Brown who will focus on E-learning and Talent Management. I will continue to report to Steve Kean. ? David Oxley will take the overall lead for HR across all business units focusing on continuing to increase the value HR brings internally to Enron. The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Business Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report jointly to their business unit OTC's and to David from a functional HR perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean. ? Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation responsibilities.

Item (4) should read \"The payment of a \"project fee\" equal to 2% of the project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in Exhibit B to this letter. Exhibit A should read as follows: Individual milestones subject to \"project fee\" payments: 1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. (\"Haywood Power\"), the abandonment by the Tennessee Valley Authority (\"TVA\") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of its Haywood County, Tennessee facility (\"Lagoon Creek\"), which results in Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement. 2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of $5 million. Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the $175,000 project fee shall be paid. 3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. (\"Calvert\"), the elimination of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 500kV transmission line from Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Calvert. Exhibit B should read as follows: The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a \"Development Project\"). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be deemed to be an approved Development Project (an \"Approved Project\"). For purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial operation of the Approved Project. For the avoidance of doubt, a project fee shall not be payable for any Development Project unless it becomes an Approved Project as defined herein. ",

You can now query based on counterparty and phys/fin in addition to specifying a deal number 2.) You no longer need to provide the leg of the deal. Specifying the peer will grab all of the legs. 3.) The new splitting process will work as follows. If the entire deal is prior to the termination date (inclusive), then nothing is done to the deal. If the entire deal is after the termination date (exclusive), then the desk is simply changed to East Bank or West Bank. If the deal crosses the termination date boundary, the deal is copied as follows: For the original deal: All legs prior to the termination date (inclusive) are not changed. All legs after the termination date (exclusive) are killed. All legs crossing over the termination date are truncated. This includes deleting strips starting after the date and truncating strips that cross over the date. For the new deal: This deal will be in one of the Bankruptcy books All legs prior to the termination date (inclusive) are not copied. All legs after the termination date (exclusive) are copied as is - no strips are changed. Any legs crossing over the termination date are copied and modified to reside solely after the date. This includes deleting strips that end prior to the date and modifying strips that cross over the date.

I know there are exceptions, but I was just curious, as lots of folks are very nervous. From the merger agreement: From and after the Effective Time, Enron employees, excluding those covered by collective bargaining agreements, will be provided severance benefits that are at least comparable in all respects to the severance benefits provided by Dynegy under its severance benefit plans and arrangements for similarly situated employees. For purposes of the foregoing obligation regarding severance, the term \"severance benefit plans and arrangements\" shall not include any individually negotiated agreements.

Please review and have your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable. I will be leaving the department I have been working in and moving to a different Enron subsidiary on October 13. If at all possible, could we try to get the Software License Agreement and the Escrow Agreement wrapped up before I leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where I left off? I think we are just about in agreement on the Software License portion. Seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern regarding providing a response time of 2 business days. I do not have any answers regarding that - maybe Vince Kaminski or Stinson Gibner can respond on this issue.

I think the agreement does that (although it's not the best language), and Debbie is adding some language to make it a bit better without sticking their nose in it too deep (I asked her to take the language from the Pompano draft). In any case, Duran wants a voice-mail from you that from a legal perspective, the termination section is sufficient to relieve us from obligations under the agreement to the extent we terminate prior to the date upon which those obligations arise. We can talk about this tomorrow. Debbie would like to have a conference call at 10 AM central if you're available. Regards, Ben",

A new business unit, Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which will include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Production Corporation (NEPCO). Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, as Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services. NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under John Gillis, President. With the majority of EE&CC and OEC's activities focused on assets and projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the efforts of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports. While EEOS will be a stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports. This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects. Consistent with this approach, Development Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units which they support. With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design, construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron's assetson a global basis. This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world.

The committee charters and memberships are set forth below. Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance. We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair. VP PRC The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.

The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area. Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization. We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program. Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe. The members of this committee are listed below. Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program. Billy joined Enron in 1992, and has served in a variety of commercial capacities across the company and has been an active participant in the Associate /Analyst program.

In all or almost all cases, we have accepted your position. The agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten. I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the case. The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron Wind. In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction with ENA versus TXU. I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse. Regards Delainey ",

There is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the counterparty identity itself. It appears that you have identified a DIFFERENT party to the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named \"SITA\", which is not the entity which we originally proposed,. This does not appear to be the credit which we evaluated. Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex. As you know, the agreement contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals. Can you call me tomorrow?

One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary damages against TVA for TVA's breach of NERC policies. In order to make such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC policies are a \"contract\" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages. One concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could possibly be damaged in other, unrelated proceedings if it was determined that NERC policies were indeed \"contractual obligations\" (e.g., a third party claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC \"contractual policies\").

Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61(should be $238,508.61) and would it be appropriate for HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream. The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998. The 1997 payments were made pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company. The information provided does not indicate when Killam made the reallocation. Based on the reallocation, HPL or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been allocated to EOG. I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from the parties that it represents. Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes. That contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation evidencing the transaction. He also stated that the volumes should have been sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy of. Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the Big Cowboy and the Spot contract. Kelly also indicated that since HPL's agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved through arbitration. Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum of $328,508.61(should be $238,508.61) from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum in suspense until the issue is resolved. HPL needs to be aware that in the event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to remit such amount together with interest to Upstream. ",

I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc. So I canibalized her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the \"clarifications\" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows). The answers are at the bottom of the work sheet. And I've also included the report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.). My biggest concern is question 6. My answer (despite some outliers) sez that there ain't no loan in June. (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a fatal flaw--significant probability.) Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials. (If you run the sheet, beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.) Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with something remotely similar.

As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and ? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus ? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or approved; and ? view an electronic image of the actual invoice These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce the time you spend processing invoices for payment. The AP tool will also begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information currently in use. This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions. This transition is expected to be completed by August 2001. You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and training opportunities in the coming weeks. Please contact your AP representative if you have any questions.",

        "clean_content": "Meeting Notes - Meeting between Crescendo and Cantera Andrew, Gerald Attached is the meeting notes from a 1 hour meeting we had with Cantera Resources and Tom Brown on April 24. We will be meeting with them again on Monday, May 7 in Dallas. This meeting will involve the president and operations manager of Cantera as well. While the last meeting was more of introductions and high level \"where we are\" and \"what are the issues\" discusssion, this meeting will be more definitive where we plan to discuss the pressure and curtailment issues in more detail, and we will be discussing moving the Entrada from San Arroyo to our plant. I am sure they will also want to discuss some sort of agreement for us to move foreward together on the low-Btu project. Tom Brown representatives will be involved via phone - as they must until the deal closes. We told Cantera it may be a very short meeting as there are certain things we won't talk about in front of Tom Brown. In our meeting on Monday - which will start at noon with lunch, I want to be able to show them a couple of things. I want to show them Graphs 2-2.1-A and 2-2.1-B and Figure 2-2.2 out of section 3 of the Contract Issues book I gave you. I want to also show them Graphs 3-2.1-A and 3-2.1-B and Figures 3-1 out of section 4 of the book. I was not planning on discussing the monitary value associated with these graphs (the sum of these issues totals just under $1MM economic harm to Crescendo as I calculated from June through December 2000.) Andrew, I will call you in the morning to discuss in more detail what we should and should not show them or discuss concerning the issues. I will be on my cell phone at 915-349-8223 all morning. Thanks, Ken Krisa - meeting notes 4-24-01 Cantera.doc",

        "clean_content": " vkamins.nsf Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive: The following is this week's Alliance Express newsletter, and a special announcement regarding a proposed action by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). FASB 133 FASB is considering an exception to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133 that will exempt energy companies from the requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives. A vote against the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility, and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers. (Attached is a summary of this issue.) The Board is expected to vote on this issue during May 2001. EEI will be taking steps to appraise FASB of our concerns. If you, or company CFO would like more information about this effort, please contact Richard McMahon, Executive Director of the Alliance of Energy Suppliers, at rmcmahon@eei.org, or at 202-508-5571. Alliance of Energy Suppliers Express=02=05April 25, 2001 INSIDE WASHINGTON FEDERAL AFFAIRS ***Bill Repealing PUHCA Is Approved By Senate Committee*** The Senate Banking Committee today approved S 206, a bill that repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The bill would repeal PUHCA and transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and appropriate state agencies. S.206 was approved with two amendments. Offered by Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), the first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition Task Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the United States. The task force would be made up of representatives of FERC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as non-voting representatives from the Department of Agriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment also contained a provision, co-sponsored by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), that would preserve FERC's authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do not include the pass-through of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy. Another amendment, offered by Sen. Jon Corzine (D-NJ), initiated a study by the General Accounting Office of the success of federal and state governments in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets. ***Institute=02=07s Tax Agreement With Public Power Again Introduced on Hill*** The tax agreement EEI reached with the American Public Power Association (APPA) and the Large Public Power Council (LPPC) again has been introduced in the House. The bill (HR 1459) contains the same provisions as were in a measure (HR 4971), with technical corrections, introduced during the 106th Congress. HR 1459 was introduced by Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) and nine original co-sponsors from the Ways and Means Committee. HR 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes: 1) The tax-free sale or spin-off of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed, 2) Nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost-of service ratemaking, 3) The contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated, and 4) Private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution facilities. The measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, and EEI has urged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward. Enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment, the Institute noted. The same legislation has been incorporated into S 389, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski's (R-AK) energy security bill, and stand-alone legislation could also be introduced. Hearings are expected to be held in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, probably after consideration of President Bush's individual tax proposal. ADMINISTRATION/FERC ***White House Seeks $2 Trillion Budget In Fiscal Year 2002*** President Bush last week transmitted a $2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget request to Capitol Hill. The Administration noted that its proposal *moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent in 2002,* an increase of $26 billion over the preceding fiscal year. The budget bid contains a $231 billion total surplus in 2002, and projects a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years. In the energy area, the Administration noted the federal government=02=07s *longstanding and evolving role* in the sector, pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts. It proposed about $2.8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs, and about $2.1 billion in tax benefits, *mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources.* DOE=02=07s budget request was$19.2 billion, including $2.3 billion for energy resources programs. This later figure represents a decrease of $196 million, or 7.9 percent, from fiscal year 2001. In the environmental sector, the Administration sought some $7.3 billion in discretionary funding for EPA, including a $3.7 billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws. ***Success of Restructuring Tied to Energy Strategy, FERC=02=07s Massey Asserts*** Electric restructuring may be in jeopardy, and its success *is in the hands of regulators and policymakers,* FERC Commissioner William Massey has asserted. Speaking at a recent National Governors Association policy forum in Philadelphia, Commissioner Massey urged officials to pay attention to the key elements of a national energy strategy. First, he specified, there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity. Turning to a second element, Commissioner Massey told forum attendees that *all the supply in the world won=02=07t help unless it can be delivered over an adequate, efficient, non-discriminatory network.* Commissioner Massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy, while citing an inherent difficulty: that *good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions.* Accordingly, he said, FERC and the states must work together on market structure. The final element of a successful energy strategy, the commissioner specified, is the need for aggressive FERC intervention when markets fail to do their job. *If the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator to ensure reasonable prices for consumers,* he cautioned, they *will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path.* NEW GENERATION ***Dynegy To Build Second Plant in Kentucky*** Dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to the Riverside Generating project in Lawrence County, Kentucky. Dynegy will sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market. Commercial operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002. ***PPL To Expand Generation Capacity*** PPL Corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near Chicago and would increase the capacity of its Susquehanna nuclear plant by 100 megawatts. CEO William Hecht said the Illinois plant is expected to be in service by the summer of 2002. ***Constellation Energy Group Announces Eight New Plants*** Constellation Energy Group this week announced that the company is scheduled to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer. Additionally, four larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two summers. The four peaking plants are located in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. The larger power plants are under construction in California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas. *We=02=07re building in these seven states because they serve regions where wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support our national power marketing business,* said Constellation Energy Group Chairman and CEO Christian Poindexter. ***California Energy Commission Approves Construction of Otay Mesa Generating Plant*** PG&E Corporation=02=07s National Energy Group (NEG) last week announced that the California Energy Commission (CEC) has approved construction of the Otay Mesa Generating Plant in San Diego County, which the NEG has developed. The 500 megawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1,000 homes. After the development process is completed, Calpine Corporation will assume ownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant. NEG will contract for up to half the plants output. ENERGY DATA *** Weekly Electric Output (Week 15)*** Electric output reached 63,528 GWh for the week ending April 14 (Week 15), with the highest increase over 2000 levels in the South Central states, which both had a 12.6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15. Year-to-date, the Rocky Mountain region experienced the greatest increase in output (7.6 percent) over 2000. For more information, email alliance@eei.org.

We need to decide whether to oppose MID's motion for order determining that contracts have been terminated. We have two agreements with MID, and apparently MID would like them terminated as forward contracts not subject to the automatic stay. In order to know whether we should be developing a legal strategy opposing MID's motion (which might be an uphill struggle), here is the factual info we need: 1. Are either or both of the contracts in the money? What is the MTM of each one? 2. When did we stop serving under each of the contracts? Are we still serving either of them? 3. Has MID paid for all the power we delivered? 4. Are there any other MID issues we should be aware of (unresolved disputes, additional confirms for other deals, etc.)? Thank you in advance for gathering those answers, and please let me know how I can help. I haven't yet seen the contracts and confirms, but I understand that you are attempting to gather them from our back office staff. I have a sense that we may end up supporting MID's motion, but we won't know for sure until we get the above answers. MID admits it owes us money under one of the contracts, but also wants to set off amounts allegedly due by EPMI under the other one. If the net is a payment to us, I would expect that we'd support a termination, although we'd likely oppose the setoff claim; we might attempt to sever treatment of the two contracts and reject the one out of the money, if we could.

I have tried to make the claim as big as possible, which makes it rather vague and wishy-washy.? Maybe you can suggest changes. At the risk of differing with Lisa and Paul, I really do not understand why this is a good idea.? It seems to me that any claim by Enron is an unsecured claim, way down in priority, clearly behind all of the bondholders, at least to the extent of their security.? I don't understand how this claim creates any threat to the plaintiffs or settlement pressure on anyone. In addition, I hate saying the things we have to say to state a claim.? In the litigation, we consistently say that we did nothing wrong, we were victims too, the few people who did sue us should see their mistake and dismiss us.? Now we propose to file a public document saying the opposite:? that we fear the suits that have been filed and we expect more, producing tens--maybe hundreds--of millions of dollars of exposure. While we should continue to move this aspect of Enron's claim along, so we are ready to file if we want to, I think we should consider a conference call among Lisa, Paul, Richard, and me to talk through the wisdom of the indemnification claim.? (I don't worry nearly so much about a fraud claim on Enron's securities purchases, because that does not go against our litigation position, although I still don't see what good such a claim would do.)

For the past several months,a project team, representing Enron's temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team's efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition. We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001. The scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two phases have been completed. Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we selected CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group based on their exceptional management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our staffing needs. The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective and simple means for obtaining temporary employees. In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group will be communicating to Enron's administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors about the new process. There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are outlined on the attached page. More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed Services team. What is Managed Services? CORESTAFF's Managed Services program includes: ? Vendor-neutral management model ? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners ? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized reporting ? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement ? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies Key Benefits ? More vendors working on each order from the outset =01) faster access to available talent pools ? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively ? Online access to requisition status for users ? Robust databases offering managers enhanced tracking and reporting of temporary usage and expenditures ? Standard and customized reporting capabilities -- online ?

        "clean_content": " jdasovic.nsf DEAR OII AND OFO SETTLEMENT PARTIES: Thank you to the parties who worked very hard to develop the September 15, 1999 OFO Settlement Proposal in response to PG&E's August 18 proposal. We have carefully reviewed your settlement offer and sought clarification where needed. As a result, PG&E is able to accept most of the changes and provisions contained in that proposal, and is offering back a few modifications which we think should allow us to reach closure on a multi-party OFO Settlement Agreement. We encourage all parties to sign this settlement. Our September 24, 1999 response is attached in two forms. One is a summary of the items we agree with and those where we have changes, including the reason for our changes. The second is a revision-marking of the September 15 proposal to show all the specific changes, including some minor edits. We have not included the tariff revisions to support this package, but will provide them once we have a final agreement. At this point, the changes to the prior tariff drafts are straight forward. Also attached is a draft Joint Motion for your review and approval. Our suggested approach is to have Settlement Parties sign the motion as the means of signifying their approval of the Settlement and the need for expeditious Commission action. We have scheduled a Settlement Conference next week on Tuesday, September 28, starting at 10:00 a.m. in Room 308, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco. HOWEVER, the attendance of a couple key parties is problematic, and we may need to move this settlement meeting to accommodate their schedules so we can ensure a productive day. We will advise you no later than Monday morning of the meeting status and possible next steps. We appreciate your continued active participation in this settlement process and look forward to your feedback on our modifications. Sincerely, Dan Thomas PG&E California Gas Transmission Manager, Products and Sales cc: Kirk Johnson Ben Campbell Patrick Golden Randy Litteneker Steve McCarty Chris McManus Roland Risser Dave Rubin Al Torres Ron Stoner Eric Eisenman Geoffrey Bellenger Attachments <<Sept 24 Summary of PG&E OFO Settlement Response.doc>> <<Sept 24 PG&E OFO Settlement Response.doc>> <<Sept 24 Draft Motion for OFO Settlement.doc>> - Sept 24 Summary of PG&E OFO Settlement Response.doc - Sept 24 PG&E OFO Settlement Response.doc - Sept 24 Draft Motion for OFO Settlement.doc",

The \"Operations/Delivery Scheduling Procedures\" only are the method by which this is effected. This change needs to be removed. 2. 1st Sentence of Second Paragraph - The remainder of the changes to the 1st Sentence except for the strike of Seller's Daily Deliverability are OK. Seller's Daily Deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct terminology under the Purchase Agreement. All we are doing here is effecting the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already agreed. 3. The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be stricken. The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create a firm purchase deal with this letter. 4. 1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from \"that quantity of Gas..... to.......... (the \"Released Gas\"\" should be removed. The term Released Gas is defined under the Purchase Agreement and doesn't need to be defined in this letter. I am OK with ENA \"hereby\" agreeing to waive any and all rights it has to under Section 3.3 to recall the Gas. However, the term rights ENA \"may\" have needs to be stricken. ENA's position is that we have the right to recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 120 days. If you wish to discuss these comments or would like me to discuss these with Phillips, I would be happy to do so. ",

        "clean_content": " shorton (Non-Privileged).pst The Bankruptcy Court has approved our sale of the IM Project to AEP. The Court's formal order will be entered sometime Friday morning. With this approval, we expect to close the sale either Friday or Saturday. Approval wasconditioned upon our agreement to the following procedures with respect tothe net sale proceeds (approximately $108mm): -$25mm will be returned to Enron (repayment of the post-petition working capital loans made to EW); -$10mm will be retained by EW for working capital to use over the next 2 weeks; -$78mm (the remaining balance) will be set aside in a restricted account of EW, pending approval by the creditor's committee of the use of thosefunds for payment of existing obligations and for ongoing working capital by EW. We have until 15 January to obtain creditors' committee approval for the use of the remaining balance, at which time if no approval is obtained, we can ask the BK Court to rule on the matter. Obtaining creditors' committee approval will require that we (a) demonstrate that the continued operation of EW as a going concern is in the bankruptcy estate's best interest (because it will enhance or at least maintain the value of EW for sale) - this demonstration will need to be made by Enron (Mark) and CSFB (Matt), and will need to include an overview of EW's value on sale, including arguments why there is significant value in the EW - Americas business unit notwithstanding the short-term issues facing the US business, and an update on the sale process; and (b) demonstrate the legitimacy of EW's current obligations and future working capital needs - this will need to be done by Umanoff and Westbeld (we initially projected that we would need approximately $54mm of the$78mm through the end of Q1, a likely closing date for sale of EW; Mike and his team will be scrubbing these numbers over the next week). We are targeting early in the week of Jan 7 to make our case to the creditors' committee, although no firm date has been set. One final note - a representative of GE attended the BK court hearing and is aware that our request to use the remaining balance to pay our past due obligations (including $9mm owing to GE) was denied pending implementation of the above procedure. We can expect continued pressure from GE. Call me with any questions. ",

For avoidance of doubt, the text of both versions are included in the letter. He said that our understanding was correct and that he would answer in the affirmative. He was not familiar with the original text. I showed him my copy with the three initials. He asked whose initials were from Furnas. (I don't know - was not present at that meeting. Rick and John may know). Roberto de la Nina gave him the background from Furnas side. Tariff and Commissioning. Celso started the session by drawing a diagram of the Contractual Obligation provisions compared to the Current Situation. He wanted to lead us to pay the fuel differential, from 100% dispatch or alternatively buy from the MAE (lower cost to us). [Comment.- Irrespective of the Force Majeure arguments that we have, the MAE make up possibility has to be used carefully to avoid falling into the trap, by precedent, or assuming a market exposure that we presently do not have.] I replied that his reading of the Contract was correct, except that he did not read the Force Majeure section. We had the obligation to change to gas on the dates he mentioned, except that we have a Force Majeure due to the Government Actions, and therefore we have the right to change the schedule. Celso replied that his people did not think this fit the case; i.e. \"additional difficulty of drilling through rocks\"; I replied that we have a strong case that everyone knows about, including the regulator Aneel, which extended the use of the CCC until June 2001. [Comment.- I expect Furnas to challenge our documentation to calculate how many days we are entitled due to FM causes. At the end there will be a \"negotiated agreement\", or the result or arbitration.] Aneel Authorization.- I told him that we needed to bring him up to date about Aneel's approval. Aneel sent us a letter that we were not authorized to operate in Combined Cycle, not that we had CCC account coverage during for CC operation. Gave him a copy of the letter of our request to Aneel asking for both ; CC and CCC coverage. We were ready for 480 MW, but on diesel. Celso asked what we would do if we got CC authorization but not CCC coverage.- I told him that we did not have the money to pay for the fuel, that we would have to convert back to Simple Cycle, use the current authorization for minimum use and wait for the gas to be available to go through commissioning. He said that under the contract we are obligated to provide power; that he would buy from the MAE and sent us the bill. I told him that under the Contract we can change the gas-change-over date because of FM. During a FM period our mutual obligations would cease, except that they in this case they had a capacity payment obligation given that the cause was Government action. He understood that they have a right to cancel the Contract after 12 months [Comment - but they would have the MAE exposure as well for the Initial Contracts] Laine gave him an update of the ridge contruction and the parallel path that we will take on Ridge 10; drill and also seek a permit for a partial crossing of the first crest, drilling through the second crest, all withing the existing ROW. Laine explained the processes and limitatios of returnind to SC operations and then back again to CC gas comissioning. Our Proposal.- Our proposal is that we get authorization to enter into operation as combined cycle unit; the CCC administration pays for the diesel, and receives the gas revenues as compensation. This keeps us and Furnas at the Contract equilibrium, and the Brazilian electric system has 480 MW combined cycle plant; providing stability to that area. Under this proposal, until the gas gets there to start commissioning, ONS would dispatch the power plant according to economic dispatch at R$110/Mwhr; minimum 290 MW. The CCC covers the actual dispatch the MRE cover the dispatch to the Initial Contracts with Furnas. I suggested that they join us for that petition to Aneel. He called Mario Santos to set up a meeting, to enlist the help of ONS in that petition as well. The meeting is set up for Wednesday at 9:30 AM. To prepare we need to provide the factual information, heat rates, costs, etc. ",

Please forward to me a copy of whatever you would like to send before you send it. Thanks, Dave Further to the recent queries you raised concerning the ETA, we can provide you with the following comfort. The final sentence of clause 2(d) prevents a Counterparty from claiming that the ETA has not been duly accepted or an offer has not been validly made or that a transaction has not been validly entered into solely by virtue of the electronic =01&click=018 method of submitting offers or execution. This same principle provides protection to you in that the only binding transactions upon both yourselves and Enron are the ones in which certain terms have been clicked upon by you and the same terms accepted by Enron through the automated EnronOnline process. The system is designed to ensure that BOTH PARTIES ARE BOUND BY the terms of the offer you submit are the only terms which ARE can be accepted by Enron. As a result, there have been no instances in which a customer offered on one set of terms, but Enron accepted a different set of terms. ",

        "clean_content": " GNEMEC (Non-Privileged).pst Barry, My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB. I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990. There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document. Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes. Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB. MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5. Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month. It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February. Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read \"30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month\". As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows: #4 The words \"or interruptible\" should be deleted from this provision. The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract. #11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received. The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing. MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt. Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days. #12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term \"letter\" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay. (b) Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met. MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice. Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice. #16 The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken. If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me. My extension is 52722. Alisha Mahabir",

        "clean_content": " sshackle.nsf To: Enron North America Corp. From: Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets, and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce the following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA. 1) Coverage/Origination: To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service companies and IPP's; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries. Downstream Coverage/Origination As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear that the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp. Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp. Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENA's existing energy commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also EES's energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel's chemicals, plastics and refined products risk management capability. These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg's leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering: a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision of paper risk management products; b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries; c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers Trust's global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to leadthe coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing industries. Midstream Coverage/Origination a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group' activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect. We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of this group; b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. They will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring opportunities in the Western U.S. We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination efforts; c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio's of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group. In addition, Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect; d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructuring opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets. We have asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair, formerly of Enron Asia's development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join this newly formed business. 2) Commercial Transactions: The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA's efficiency in executing transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage. CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management. The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership, execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups. This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions: a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western Coverage/Origination Groups. The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy Lemmons joined Enron in 1992. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA's industrial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining, Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established. The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich. We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups. The senior members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud and John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix. We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups. The senior members of this team include Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert. We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend. Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams. Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group. The remaining four groups within CTG will remain largely unchanged. In addition, the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together. We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ENA's markets particularly in the industrial markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups. Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in North America by working with us to implement these changes.",

I am awaiting material from Houston to complete the piece on NYC. One piece that I think needs to be added to the detailed briefing note is an overview of Enron's current commercial position in Ontario - i.e. the renegotiation of the BE contract and the likelihood of pursuing a retail initiative. You will see where I have left space for that piece, hoping that you could draft it. I have endeavoured in the outline of the speaking points to focus on what we know the key issues/concerns for the government are at this stage. I have asked Sasha Jacob to provide us with profiles of Harris, Wilson, Purchase and Hubert to include in the final briefing package. I have prepared the material on the assumption that the best use of the meeting time (likely 45 minutes with Harris and 60 minutes with Wilson et al) is: a) to make the case for proceeding with market opening this Fall if the IMO and OEB reports re market readiness are positive; b) to provide Harris et al with our perspective on developments in the U.S. (particularly New York and California) about which the government may have continuing concerns; and c) to ask Harris what we can do to help the gov't move forward to a market opening this year. Rick Shapiro left me a voice mail indicating that Lavorato and he had spoken about the visit and the supporting material. The agreement between the two of them is evidently that Rob, you and I are all to be comfortable with the briefing material before sending it to John, who will then review it and propose any changes he feels are necessary before it is forwarded to Ken Lay. I would appreciate your questions, comments and suggested revisions. D.A.D. ",

There are 6 major items that need to be completed prior to closing this transaction. The items and the expected completion dates are outlined below: Closing Item Expected Completion Date Status 1. Execution of LOU August 4 Several issues remain to be negotiated. I do not anticipate any problem in reaching mutual agreement on the issues. Border meets with their audit committee on August 2 and hopes to sign August 3. Will be in the position to review with you and Dave on August 1 or 2. 2. Employment Issues August 14 Offers of employment/transfer are in the process of being designed and prepared. Primary issues include a) identification and handling of ENA end-of-year bonus compensation (Shiela Knudson is coordinating this and I feel this issue is being adequately addressed). b) potential disparity between GPG and ENA incentive compensation plans. I am working with Bill Cordes and Ann Vaughn w/ GPG on developing a plan that will address this issue. Based on the conference call with Bill and Ann this morning, I am optimistic that this issue will be properly addressed. The plan is to have employment issues identified in a letter and presented to employees on August 7th. 3. Reserve Consultants August 11 Kicked off consultants in a meeting in Omaha on July 26th. We are providing information and assisting in the process. 4. Due Diligence August 25 A detailed schedule of all due diligence activity is being updated by Northern Border and I will forward that schedule to you once I receive the update. 5. Hart, Scott Rodino September 8-15 There is a high probability that a Hart, Scott, Rodino filing will have to be made upon execution of the LOU. There is a 30 day review period. This may be the critical path item. 6. Drafting/Negotiating PSA September 8-15 Shonnie Daniel is coordinating the drafting of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. It is expected that this agreement will be agreed upon in early to mid September. One key date you should be aware of is Northern Border is anticipating making a press release after the LOU is executed (release date is expected to be August 7). They will be coordinating press release issues with Eric Thode. I feel confident that this transaction will be closed in September. If you have any questions, please let me know. ",

        "clean_content": "MPLP PPA Dispute PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT DO NOT DISTRIBUTE Elizabeth: I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY. While I think we should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for a few days. I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions. Also, I'll have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I thought I could generally review the PPA in any event. In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one might look like on paper. (See attached). At this point, however, I'm not sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be adjusted on a calendar year basis. You will note that the draft letter focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D. As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position. Preliminary Overall Assessment The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue. While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for \"Year 1\" only would apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for \"Year 35\" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract Term. The anomaly \"running in the other direction\" is that, under CMS's interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis (e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would be applied \"mid-stream\" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged \"contract year\" ). My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly (described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year concept (i.e., the 21 month \"Year 35\" issue) since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around.. More Information/Diligence/Research Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you forwarded): --The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) in a published Order. Was there anything in that Order or the submissions (or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide some guidance? --My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance where the COD was not a Jan.1. Do we (or local counsel) know whether this may be a \"global\" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs? --While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the \"excess\" capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims. --CMS \"self bills\" itself under the PPA. Has the statute of limitations run on any of its claims for refunds for prior years? Can CMS's prior course of dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior \"overpayments\" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity payments)? (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis only). --The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC. Isn't this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any particular period? Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the \"excess\" amount in rates? --Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the PUC? If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall restructuring of the PPA? Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position --The definition of \"Contract Capacity Factor\" provides for a calendar year determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar year. If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation. --Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D \"shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined.... (Emphasis added). This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next anniversary of the COD. It arguably would not appear to make any sense to apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not require an adjustment. --NOTE: The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only pertains to the computation of a percentage \"haircut\" or adjustment that is applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective. That is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in conflict with the rest of the PPA. --Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 years \"and thereafter from year to year,\" unless a party gives at least one year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective \"at the end of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter.\" (Emphasis added). Thus, for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October 31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 (i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD). Thus, the PPA contemplates in certain respects certain \"stub\" years and certain \"long\" years, a contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D. --There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a calendar year basis. (We should discuss with the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be additional support in that respect). (Note that some other calendar year based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can still be used to reflect the underlying \"calendar year\" flavor of the PPA since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment). A Few Additional Points to Note --The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA. --Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an \"indication\" of a regulatory disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its \"contract year\" interpretation of Exhibit D. While Sec. 10(c) is one of those \"old school\" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of the PUC to support its contract claim. (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification to attempt to break a PPA with a QF). Let me know when you wish to follow up.

These meetings are mandatory for all Director and equivalent level staff within the organisation across all Enron companies in Australia. The meetings will be held in the boardroom at 4.30PM on each Monday (or Tuesday in case of holiday). Accordingly, I encourage you to avoid scheduling any conflicts with this timing. The first meeting will be held on Monday 30 October. David Minns will play a central role to the coordination of the commercial activities of this group. Please supply David with a list of your group's major deal initiatives should you intend to be absent from this meeting. In David's absence please provide me with this list should you be unable to attend this meeting in person or not be in a position to dial in to the meeting. In addition, Heidi Mason will assume greater responsibility for coordinating support resources throughout office. All administrative staff will report to Heidi in addition to their current direct report. The assumption of greater coordinating responsibility for David and Heidi is designed to maximise the amount of effort each Director is expending on direct commercial activities as well as increasing efforts to maximise existing resources and cross-commodity deal opportunities. A general office email will be sent advising of this initiative. This email will also incorporate explicit comment on reporting and expense obligations.

        "clean_content": " sscott3.nsf Per your request, here is my summary of the conversations that we have had to date about complying with the new marketing affiliate requirements in Standard L. Frazier, Maria or Susan -- jump in if I missed something. New Standard L Requirements Shared Employees. Reporting on shared employees & facilities (161.3 (l)(2)(i) and 161.3(l)(2)(ii)(c) is the easy part -- as we have no shared employees and I think we have only minor shared facilities which are disclosed in our standards of conduct. Thus, we may want to tackle the shared facilities by posting our Standards of Conduct. Relative Position of Entities in the Organization. With respect to 161.3(l) (ii)(A). Frazier has put together a idea about showing the relative position of the pipeline and the marketing affiliates in the corporate structure. Here's a sample of how the Northern reporting chain would look: Enron Corp. Enron Pipeline Holding Company Enron Operations Corp. Enron Pipeline Company Northern Natural Gas Pipeline Org. Charts, Titles, Job Descriptions (and names of supervisory employees). Section 161.3(l)(ii)(B) is probably the hardest part of the new requirements. Frazier took the task of getting with HR to pull together initial org charts, titles and descriptions. Since then I saw the new SAP employee system which lists job titles & descriptions. Perhaps HR can get the information from there. My \"to do\" is to get a couple samples of how the similar employee org. chart data is presented on the electric side in OASIS. Bambi -- I'll make sure to include you in our next discussion. Frazier - have you had a chance to talk with HR -- let us know when you are ready to get back together to discuss.",

Invitations to the event were sent approximately two weeks ago. The invitations listed the agenda and speakers. We have completed incorporating the biography and photograph that you provided into the program brochure. During the event, we have allocated 20 minutes, beginning at 1:40PM, for your remarks on Markets in Transition. We expect your remarks to be broad in scope and to provide your views on how the economic and market factors of recession, technology evolution, and heightened security are impacting the business landscape. Our hope is that your remarks will be generic in nature -- Markets in Transition is a concept that applies to virtually all industries. We understand that you will make no reference to Enron. Furthermore, there will be no question and answer session after your presentation. We will take measures to ensure that the press has no access to you before or after your remarks. Please return the speaker logistics form (requested separately) at your earliest convenience. We look forward to your participation.

My understanding is that surprisingly some of the money that we've already submitted has been paid due (despite the fund being depleted) to overpayment/accounting issues with other entities. This also has to do w/ the time lapse between filing for reimbursement for 3 months prior (i.e. I don't think Richard anticipated getting paid for some of January's purchases because technically the fund ran out inDecember).

Thanks Heather for the helpful update. -----Original Message----- From: Mathis, Heather Sent:Tuesday, July 31, 2001 1:30 PM To:Bolton, Stacey; Ring, Richard; Castano, Marianne Subject:CA BIZMIX Issues Hello all! I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regarding the DASRing of customers in California. Unfortunately it wasn't what we wanted to hear. On the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) were turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.) These customers received a letter letting them know about it. On the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small commercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed. In PGE & SCE,IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continuously received our product. All other PGE & SCE customers were originally submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!! That provides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that. PGE did a virtual switch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, when a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc. All de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Diann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but new contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DASRed to us. No communication about all of this has been sent to the customers, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to our larger customers through the reps. So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them an annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why they're still receiving info from us). As far as the commercial/industrial....... 1. No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolton, Stacey] We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with Peggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP. 2. They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceedingas if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just received indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey] We should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if we will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you don't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% delta band between projection and actual.. We can change the projection for third quarter and include this information in the customer letter. 3. What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time as of June 21) being told they are receiving? Are they being marketed BIZMIX? [Bolton, Stacey] We should ensure this is not the case with origination. Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know. 4. As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use those given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolton, Stacey] We should discuss this a bit. I'm not sure that this will really matter at the end of the day. The CEC has instructed us all along to send labels to the customers, which we have. We'll report the purchases (brown and green) as normal at the end of the year. Let me know your input.

        "clean_content": "Legal Issus with Hypertext Links As Louise mentioned briefly in today's meeting, we need to obtain a view on the legal implications of \"linking\" web pages and the news and information they contain. Some specific issues we will need a perspective on include: 1) Legal issues associated with providing hypertext links to: - 3rd party websites (avoiding unauthorized links such as in the Shetland Times case in the UK). These sites may include other interesting energy sites - links to news items (external URL sites), etc.. Is mutual consent enough? What are the liability issues? 2) The flipside: Potentially allowing linking of our Enron Online site onto websites of third parties, (e.g. in the form of click of simple hyperlinks or through \"banner ads\" which would take users from the external site, such as an FT.com, and bring them to our site as a marketing tool). *3) Issue of Publishing/Re-distributing/Re-purposing news or other business information from other sources (e.g. E-Trade shows Reuters news - what sort of legal agreement are they likely to have in place on a global basis?) (e.g. Coral Energy - have an up-to-the-minute energy news presence with all stories footnoted as \"copyright 1999 by FWN\" - presumably another external news agency). Most of the above relates to our plans for a \"News Viewer\" and \"Links Page\" which would encompass both : i) publishing Enron commodity-related news to external (and internal) users. ii) displaying/re-distributing commodity news provided by an external agency (e.g. Reuters, etc.) to external and internal users. How do we satisfy the copyright requirements of others (i), and ensure we get full copyright protection for our own news (ii) given that all of the above will likely be viewable globally ? 4) As discussed today, providing multiple hypertext links to GTCs . Although it would be far more preferable to automatically personalize the site such that only legal information relevant to that customer is seen, as a fall back option, would there be any issues showing the multiple links (i.e. would users know which GTCs applied to them if bombarded with various options).

For the past several months,a project team, representing Enron's temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team's efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition. We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001. The scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two phases have been completed. Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we selected CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group based on their exceptional management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our staffing needs. The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective and simple means for obtaining temporary employees. In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group will be communicating to Enron's administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors about the new process. There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are outlined on the attached page. More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed Services team. What is Managed Services? CORESTAFF's Managed Services program includes: ? Vendor-neutral management model ? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners ? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized reporting ? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement ? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies Key Benefits ? More vendors working on each order from the outset =01) faster access to available talent pools ? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively ? Online access to requisition status for users ? Robust databases offering managers enhanced tracking and reporting of temporary usage and expenditures ? Standard and customized reporting capabilities -- online ?

The Commission ordered Elektro to republish 2001, 1Q2001 and 2Q2002 statements. The Commission argues that: 1) The deferral of income tax and social contribution was not legitimate, as it was based on irrealistic profit assumptions 2) That instructions regarding the term to ammortize part of the reverse merger, issues in 1999, have not been followed (CVM instruction 319/99, which approved the reverse merger) 3) The economic rationale for the ammortization of the larger part of the \"premium\" paid for Elektro does not hold any longer and that CVM Instruction 349/2001 is not being followed 4) As per Law 6.385/76, Elektro will have to republish the balance sheets/income statements Elektro has 15 days to appeal LM",

QF3405.1, QG7130.1, NY2665.1 and NY5271.1 Premstar Energy Canada has requested that the Payment Dates for the above noted financial transactions be amended to conform with physical settlement from \"The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable\" to \"The twenty fifth (25th) day of the month following each Determination Period. Should the Payment Date fall on a weekend or statutory holiday, payment shall be made on the next Business Day.\". My comments are as follows: 1. Russell, kindly confirm that there is no credit concern with extending the financial payment cycle; 2. Laura/Cheryl, kindly confirm that it is something that we have done in the past for financial transactions; 3. Melinda, assuming that Russell, Laura/Cheryl do not have concerns, please prepare an amendment to each of the Confirmation Letters as requested by Premstar, except that the final sentence of their requested amendment should read: \"Should the Payment Date fall on a Saturday or statutory holiday other than a Monday, then payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, and if the Payment Date is a Sunday or statutory holiday falling on a Monday, then payment shall be made on the immediately following Business Day.\". This will make the Payment Dates consistent with physical gas settlement. 4. Melinda, if this amendment is not approved by Russell, Laura or Cheryl, I think that an amendment is nonetheless necessary to the Payment Date, as it is not the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable, but rather the fifth (5th) Business Day of the month following each Determination Period. 5. If possible, Premstar would like the amendment to be effective for the February, 2001 Determination Period. 6. Premstar would also like this provision to extend to any and all future Financial Swap transactions done with them. Mary, is there any amendment required to the ISDA to effect such a permanent amendment, or is this a matter that can be dealt with in each subsequent confirmation letter? Regards, Peter ",

        "clean_content": "Encore Issues List Keith: As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA: 1. We cannot agree to cross-acceleration. [KF: I assume you are referring to \"Default under Specified Transaction\". Encore's view (and the view of a majority of its counterparties) is that where the same parties have both physical and financial transactions outstanding, a default under one category of transaction is sufficiently significant that it should trigger a default under the other. There may be reasons why Enron feels this is inappropriate, and we would appreciate your comments.] 2. There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed. Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks accept in its credit agreements. [KF: In the transactions documented in November/December of last year, the $100 million threshold was accepted as a materiality threshold in relation to Enron Corp., and a $50 million threshold was accepted for Epcor Utilities Inc. I'm not sure why the reduction to $25 million for Epcor was suggested. More importantly, I understand Mike Roach and Ed Sacks have been discussing an alternative, which would be a percentage of net tangible assets, and that Mr. Sacks was going to give that some thought. 3. We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy. [KF: Our concern is that creates a risk for the non-insolvent party in relation to other creditors of the bankrupt party who may have automatic termination clauses in their agreements. The short-form agreements signed in late 2000 appear to accept automatic termination.] 4. We prefer the Loss method. [KF: Are you opposed to the non-defaulting party having the choice between Loss and Market Quotation?} 5. We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the \"materially weaker\" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the Credit Support Annex. We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for posting an LC. [KF: I need to discuss the first point with Mike Roach. With respect to the second point, we are advised by Epcor's treasury group that the time frame is necessary, and that is part of the reason we wish to have cash qualify as Eligible Collateral; if the time frame is required to produce an LC, we would envision putting up cash within, say, a two Business Day period and substituting an LC when it is issued.] 6. We would like to make the GP of Encore a \"Specified Entity\". We need to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of \"Specified Transaction\" to include physical transactions. [KF: I assume this is related to your first point.] 7. In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a cure through the posting of collateral. [KF: Agreed; I assume the value would be an amount determined by the other party, acting reasonably?] 8. We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b). [KF: If Alberta law is to apply, we thought Alberta courts should have jurisdiction. I understand that both parties have offices and conduct business in Alberta.] 9. We need to discuss the arbitration language. [KF: For background, this language was proposed by Enron and is consistent with the approach taken in the prior agreements.] 10. We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of Default Rate and Interest rate. [KF: Again, this was done to \"Canadianize\" the agreement. References to U.S. rates when the currency is Canadian dollars didn't seem appropriate.] 11. Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity Definitions Supplement? [KF: I intended only to modify them as set out in the Schedule.] 12. In the \"Recording\" section we would like to add the phrase \"To the extent permitted by applicable law\" at the beginning of the last sentence. [KF: Agreed.] 13. We cannot agree to No Fault Termination. [KF: This is a significant issue. In the event of a fixed for floating price swap and a protracted disruption in the Alberta Power Pool price, my understanding is that Enron would expect the swap to continue with the floating price being determined hourly by quotes from two reference dealers. Our view is that creates a significant risk to both parties that the commercial basis for their agreement will be undermined and that No Fault Termination is the better approach.] 14. We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial obligations. Looks like LC's would be the only form of acceptable collateral. [KF: Mike Roach advised me about the Surety Bond issue. He also advised that Enron has concerns about cash qualifying as collateral because of concerns about perfecting a security interest in cash. Can you outline the concerns?] 15. We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding amounts. [KF: I understand that is part of the discussion between Messrs. Sacks and Roach. I also understand Mr. Sacks is undertaking due diligence concerning what he perceives to be the \"political risk\" in the Alberta marketplace, and that this needs to be completed before the specific credit issues are addressed. Can you confirm?] 16. We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer. [KF: I expect both parties have LC facilities established and this point in part involves understanding which banks are involved. If the Epcor information has not been provided, please let me know and I will arrange to have it passed on.] I look forward to hearing from you.

Based upon our conversations, I have revised both agreements to reflect the general concepts discussed. Since I take no pride in authorship, if wordsmithing needs to be done that is fine, but I hope I have at least hit the concepts accurately. The attached blacklined documents have incorporated the changes reflected in my draft of 3/29/01. The clean drafts incorporate all changes from prior versions and the changes I made this evening. Since both Bob and Michael will be reviewing these documents in the morning, it is possible they may have some additional comments.

Seller has insisted that we give them a maximum number of non-union employees that we will want them to terminate. We have suggested that the maximum number be 30. This seems good at least for WARN Act purposes. As it is currently contemplated (not in the documents but rather in the most recent negotiations), we would provide the Seller with written notice (no later than 3 or 4 business days before closing but after our financing contingency has expired) as to which employees would need to be terminated. One other thing that I have heard is that we want the Seller to be the terminating party because the commercial folks would prefer not to have to tell our analysts that we did the firing. If you and the other labor folks feel strongly about making the Buyer the terminating party, please call me ASAP and I can hook you in with Rodney Malcolm et al to discuss.

I am confused as to how many trades actually exist. Per TAGG, there are two (NH9975.1 done on May 12 and Q25809.1 done on October 4); however, in the legal database Susan references a September 13 template sent out which Louise Paul also mentioned. Is this a real deal or was it just a draft? As the May confirm was never signed, I do not know if we will need to actually assign it to the new entity. We need to make sure that all of the confirms reference PIC as the contracting entity with PII as guarantor. All of the credit terms apply; however they will apply to the guarantor now instead of the counterparty. I have also changed the MAC trigger to B+ as PII has been downgraded from BB- to B+. I have attached a new credit worksheet for your reference. If there are any other inconsistencies to the previous documents other than what I have referenced, please let me know. Also, the database mentions the Enron Corp gty that was delivered in conjunction with the May trade. Can you confirm the amount at $15MM as well as send me a copy for my file?

As you know, Reliance and ONGC owe EOGIL approximately $7.1 and $10.3 million, respectively (including interest on non-payment). The arbitration notices reflected only the non-payment numbers which are $5.8 and $7.3 million for RIL and ONGC respectively. We finalized the drafting and dated the notices on July 29th and we delivered the official notice during business hours Monday July 31, 2000. This was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in other means, but as I noted to the OOC after the June meetings this was the only solution in the end. While nobody likes to file arbitration, the good news is in the end all parties seen this as the only solution and as best as I can tell, at least internally ONGC and Reliance support this decision. If the issue gets external, I don't know how any of the parties will respond. Our goal is to keep it as low keyed as possible, but this is India and I would expect someone to try to make a big issue out of it. I will be in contact with John Ambler today to discuss the details of the submittal and to prepare for any response to the media that may be necessary. While both parties were expecting the notice, it may leak into the media over the next few days. Please defer any questions or comments to either John Ambler, Larry Morse or myself regarding this issue. Until John advises us otherwise, our comment will be as follows; \" The parties (ONGC, Reliance and Enron Oil and Gas India Limited) have had a dispute on certain cost items and together we have agreed it is best for the joint venture to have this dispute resolved by an independent third party using the guidelines as set forth in the Joint Operating Agreement.\" Mike Smalling in our office will coordinate this matter with John Ambler and the appropriate staff. I will be available to respond if necessary and my contact numbers are as follows; office-713-853-5934 pager 888-493-1770 cell 713-569-4713 home 281-320-2198 Larry, please make sure our office understands that only you are to comment on this and any other official E&P business in India and Wade/Sanjay would you share this note with the appropriate people in your office so nobody is surprised if something comes up.

        "clean_content": " sbeck.nsf This is the response I put together for Louise. This may be better done in person. If so, give me a call when you have time. Here is my vision of the two worlds - Enron and Commodity Logic. There are two basic alternatives: If you see Commodity Logic as an independent venture, then we should build-in independence in our communication of deal data. The \"Transaction Store\" does this. Beth's DriveTrain project being led by John Simmons will provide this. In this model, not every function/system currently performed will be supplanted by a Commodity Logic module. Complete reliance on Commodity Logic to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the integration as Commodity Logic may reside outside the firewall. The systems/functions we don't think we'll outsource to Commodity Logic are: Trade Capture, Contracts, Valuation, Credit, and SAP functions. Additionally, we would like to see the development of more reporting support for the DPR, Operations Pricing Model, EnTelligence, and SAP Warehouse data; the implementation of a workflow, issue-tracking tool; and an Enron-branded site for Customer Information. This vision was arrived at by asking the question: \"What would you never consider outsourcing, either due to competitive advantage, control issues, or confidentiality?\" I started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so this week to get feedback for finalization. If the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward, then certainly a single deal database could suffice. In this case, there should not be separately managed IT functions as redundant development efforts may occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities. Right now, Commodity Logic is heavily dependent upon Beth's resources to provide the data from the legacy systems. The work to do these data feeds competes with other priorities currently underway such as Unify Performance, Alberta Open Access for Power, etc. I think it is important to note that we have two different requirements for deal data. One - to support Commodity Logic functions - is transactional and near-realtime in nature. The second - to support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process. The technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and performance requirements. So, in a combined world, there would still probably be two sources of deal data, one present on our network as separate messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to subscribe to and a second source in a warehouse for reporting. Either alternative can be approached, however organizational alignment and priorities might be different. Further, if the intent is to break Commodity Logic off into a separate entity, then the first alternative is preferred to maintain arms-length independence. Another alternative is to consider Operations and Commodity Logic as a combined entity that is separate from Enron that offers systems and back-office services to Enron and other industry players. I think this may be what Sally is envisioning. If this is where we are headed, then some of Beth's resources that are directly tied to support of Operations' systems should be combined with Commodity Logic resources so we can have a focus on coordinated priorities. I believe this alternative has the same issues as the first in terms of what is outsourced, e.g. becomes part of Commodity Logic, and what remains proprietary and confidential to Enron. Let me know your thoughts. ",

Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history. Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond. 2. Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC. Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval. Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this. 3. Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law. John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations. In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future. John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances. 4. Uriel Dutton. Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following: a. F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the \"Method and System for the Determination of VAR\"). b. F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial. c. Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration. We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week. Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone. Proposed going forward strategy: Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J. We invite comments. Britt ",

In general, if they are low dollar (e.g. $500), then I don't believe you need to specifically exclude them.

Please review from a legal stand point and advise. - - - Though the generator bearings are operating correctly, the Brownsville turbine vendor has implemented an upgrade to these bearings at other plants. Enron will make commercially reasonably efforts to get the vendor to conduct this upgrade as a warranty item. - - - The Caledonia turbine vendor has recently issued a Technical Information Letter (TIL) that could limit turbine operations during low ambient conditions. Enron will make commercially reasonable efforts prior to deal closing to implement the control curve changes recommended in the TIL - - - Enron will continue to make commercially reasonable efforts to install new silencers on the exhaust of units 1 and 2 at Brownsville in an attempt to mitigate possible start-up noise. Enron will provide XXXXXXX copies of technical descriptions of the silencer improvements once received from the vendor. If vendors provide possible solutions that substantially deviate from a silencer upgrade, Enron will get xxxxxxx's concurence prior to proceeding.

I have noted in paragraph 6(h) (and the same comments applies to paragraph 6(i)) that I need further explanation of the provision itself, and I will be happy to discuss this provision with someone from Enron or someone in our shop. For the most part, the agreement looks pretty good. Most of my changes focused on the arbitration clause. Given the nature of this Agreement, we should be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for example, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron Energy Services). If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we may want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and Dynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an exhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect at the time this Netting Agreement is executed.

        "clean_content": "Update from California Legislature Tuesday 1-30 Note: Please forward this note to the appropriate people within Enron. I do not have access to all the email addresses after hours. Today the special Wright Assembly committee held an infomational hearing on bankruptcy procedures. No substantive action. However, at his evening briefing Assmblyman Wright said that ABX -18 was now stripped down to just the \"arrearage\" language and was only 4 pages. It should be out soon. There is no schedule for a hearing, but the next hearing will be to vote on a bill. Our proposed language on the end of the rate freeze is under consideration. Edison has agreed to support our concept and wants to see a redraft of the language making it explicit that they can recover past costs in the future. We will provide a draft to them tomorrow morning. The Senate appropriations committee met all day to work over the ABX-1 bill and considered amendments and testimony. The bill included amendments suspending all direct access once the DWR was buying power. We have a major problem in that Sen Burton, Bowen, and Assmblyman Keeley all believe that the DWR will get lower prices and avoid stranded contract costs in the later years of the contract if customers are locked into the DWR market. The witness from NYMEX described this approach as making sure the state goes broke as soon as possible. We offered our amended language to preserve existing and future direct access to staff. After the recess the bill had not been amended. I presented testimony supporting direct access, as did many consumer groups, UC/CSU, and industrial customers. The compromise from the chair was to promis that language would be added to grandfather in existing direct access contracts which could be retain, renegotiated or renewed. However, the CPUC could suspend the right to enter into new direct access deals. Sen. Bowen committed to introduce a \"clean up\" bill tomorrow which could deal comprehensively with the issue and perhaps detail the conditions under which customers could choose direct access in the future. However, as the bills are not \"joined\" in legislative parlance, we have no real assurance that the Bowen bill will be passed or signed. We have a major selling job to do in conjunction with the other ESPs, and customer groups in order to try to get this fixed. NEV tried to introduce amendments which would impose very specific conditions on new direct access, preferring to spell out the language in the bill rather than risk getting an adverse decision from the CPUC. We indicated our unwillingness to support significant restrictions on future industrial direct access, and they did not push the language too hard, but we now have to have Enron get more involved in determining ARM's position. Aaron Thomas and Counihan will be working on this tomorrow in Sacto. For tomorrow, my suggested action points are as follows: Jim Steffes should brief Sue Mara on his suggestions for managing direct access under the new structure, and she should try to contact Aaron and Rick, while Sandi and I will do the same from here. We will advise you of any other major developments. Mike Day ",

Cc:Ceklund@llgm.com Subject:PX Committee Richard, sorry about the mix up. The damage has been undone with a call toWeg and Cohen changing our vote to a loud no. I apologize. I really don't want to be out in front of the client, particularly in a case in which I myself cringe at the creative ways lawyers are coming up with to keep themselves busy. When I couldn't reach you before the committee conference, I called Lisa to ascertain whether she still was in the PX loop. We talked about the committee call. She actually participated for the first few minutes to express her view that our committee should not be filing in formal motion to expand the PG & E committee. We briefly discussed the arbitration issue, and she did not appear adverse to commencement of the arbitration. Maybe that wasn't formal clearance to vote. Lesson learned. I want to avoid any such problem in the future. Unless I hear otherwise from you, on substantive issues I won't vote until I clear positions with you personally. However, we have to find a better way for me to get your take on particularpoints because they will continue to arise as Weg and Cohen (not to mention other attorneys who participate on the committee) urge the committee to take actions in the interest of discharging our fiduciary duty. Case in point, the Weg settlement. Have you decided whether to withdraw the approval you previously communicated. If it would help the communication, I'm perfectly willing to talk with you evenings or weekends. Then again, you wife might react like mine if her privacy at home is interrupted. In any event, assuming that Enron wants to stay on the committee, probably a good idea just to reign in the lawyers, let me know how we can most effectively communicate so that I know your position and can convey it when you are not available for a call. Incidentally, with you impending trip, feel free to call me over the weekend at 626-683-7644 if you want to discuss this further.

The team was directed to identify business areas that would benefit from the integration and potential sharing of systems. Todd Busby and I are leading this effort. In summary, our 3 week project plan includes developing a baseline process and information flow diagram across EES and WHS for Jan. '02, recommendations to be implemented by June '02 and our business vision for one integrated EES/WHS system solution by June '03. Beth Perlman provided Accenture on 10/15 to assist in the facilitation and analysis of the data gathered. Todd and I began the project on Monday, 10/15/01 and we will complete our initial analysis on Friday, 11/02/01 (3 week effort). Last week we completed a project scope, schedule and initial high level information flow diagram which I have enclosed below. In summary, we are holding approx. 5 workshops a week with the business leads in the integration team. On Wednesday, 10/31, we will spend the day with EES/WHS IT to complete systems overlay's on our business process and information flows. I have sent invites for the meetings listed in the schedule below and look forward to working with you and your employees in the workshops. Please call me with questions and comments regarding our plan and deliverables. Thank you for your support on this effort. Debra Debra Bailey East Power Desk o: 713-853-1657 c: 713-569-4650 ",

This means that: Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 $180,000 Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 $120,000 Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000) So, Tom will cover $180,000 of this expense Greg's adjusted Expense is ($520,000) Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000 of accrual value which had not been previously recognized.

In the case of an assignment to a party described in (ii), (vi), or (vii) (other than Enron Engineering & Construction or NEPCO), Seller shall be entitled to request and receive an appropriate guaranty, letter of credit, payment bond or other reasonable form of payment security, in amount not to exceed the amount of the Purchase Amount remaining to be paid at the time of the assignment, unless the assignor agrees to remain liable for all future liabilities under this Agreement. A letter of guaranty, letter of credit, or payment bond provided by an entity rated BBB+ or better shall be deemed to be an appropriate form of security for the purpose of this provision , so long as payment in full has been made in accordance with the schedule set forth in Article VI.

(2) Sara and I were also curious as to whether, or to what extent, CFTC licensing/registration/disclosure requirements may apply \"upward\" to any Enron entities or their officers.

As you will see, NewCo will be well positioned to be the market leading service provider to the Forest Products industry. Revenue generation opportunities exist from software ASP models/licensing, consulting engagements and in the transactional/logistics arena of the Exchange. More important, these supplier and buyer interactions all lead to increased funnel throughput for Clickpaper to EIM. There are tremendous network effects resulting from this full service, continuum of offerings. Relative to deal structure, the PEx management team remains open to identifying a structure that works for both Enron and ENW. This could be as simple as an outright purchase of PEx or slightly more complex merging of assets into NewCo. Per my comments at PaperWeek, if there is a deal to be done, arguably, it makes sense to combine interests prior to PEx making any other moves now under consideration. Let's determine, once and for all, if there is a leveragable position that meets the goals of Enron and will position NewCo to thrive as a significant player in the Forest Products industry.

David, it can be challenged by Canadian tax authorities as an unlawful evasion if the taxable event has already occurred, and the tax is owed both by an employee as income tax and by the employer for withholding tax. An arrangement or scheme that attempts to undo a taxable event that has already occurred may be challenged as a collusive attempt to evade taxes already due and owing. It is kind of like trying to push the toothpaste back in the tube; it can be a mess. Just because we may not understand it does not mean there is no problem. Based on Enron's policy of compliance with the law in jurisdictions in which it does business, it is my recommendation that a written opinion of Canadian tax counsel be obtained based on a review of the facts and the documents. I see this as a sensitive area that requires prudence and, if necessary, an extra step to make sure that reasonable steps are taken to make sure that Enron policy is observed and complied with.

Peter Leier asked me to work with you on progressing this master in his absence. Please note that the credit provisions reflect the discussions that each of our credit departments have had over the last several months. The guarantees referred to here have already been negotiated in the context of another deal (which will be brought under the umbrella of this Master when it is executed), and they are due to be executed and delivered by each party very soon. We have included our standard provision that will bring all outstanding transactions listed on Attachment A under the terms of the EEI MAster, but we have not included an attachment yet b/c there may be several outstanding transactions by the time we execute this master. Also note that my comments have borrowed heavily on the provisions of the ISDA agreement and schedule that I understand is being executed this week between Engage and Enron North America Corp. For example, you had checked the box on the Cover Sheet electing sec. 2.4 to apply, but that provision would be inconsistent with the ISDA Schedule 5(e). We believe it is preferable to follow the basic structure of the EEI documentation as other industry members are doing, leaving the \"boilerplate\" Master unmarked and putting all the changes at the end of the Cover Sheet, and so that's where you'll see the standard language that Enron adds to the Master. We believe that, true to the bilateral nature of these arrangements, such changes benefit both parties. Rather than attaching a separate Supplement, we would add to the Cover Sheet the changes you proposed in the Supplement after we've negotiated those changes.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather than a guaranty. If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know so that we can stop this process. Comments on the Draft Schedule: 1. Part 1(a) \"Specified Entity\": A Specified Entity is an entity other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a termination event. The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified Entity. I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a Specified Entity with respect to TBS. 2. Part 1(b) \"Threshold Amount\": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up. 3. Part 1(h) \"Additional Event of Default\": If we use a swap arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity. If that is the case, do we want an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest in TBS could result in termination? 4. Part 2 \"Representations\": I think that we need someone in tax to determine whether TBS can make the representations. 5. Part 4(d) & (e) \"Credit Support Provider\": Shell will be the credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one. 6. Part 4(g) \"Governing Law\", 4(h) \"Arbitration\": The schedule proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas. It would seem to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami, under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price). Comment on the Proposed Confirmation: I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas Supply Agreement under the \"Fixed Amount Details\" but have not done so under the \"Floating Amount Details\", which cross-references the provisions of the SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions. Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments or any comments on the attached confirmation. I will contact Nasim to discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to completion. Regards, Dean <<SWAPCON1.doc>> - SWAPCON1.doc",

We would like to include Enron as a signatory party to the comments, so please read them to make sure that you are okay with us signing on. Although the date issue is somewhat amorphous (we support PJM (with a Nov 2003 date but we also urge implementation as soon as possible -- Dec 2002 if possible). This was the best we could get the Coalition to agree to -- there are many parties who strenuously opposed advocating any date early than Nov 2003 and I had to threaten to take our name off the comments if we didn't say something about an earlier date. We have not given final signoff, but they would like to hear from us by the end of the day (comments are due tomorrow). Susan, please show the comments to Kevin, Dana, Paul (and anyone else who would like to see them). We are also writing our own comments, which we will circulate by COB today for filing tomorrow. They do not need to read the affidavits -- just the comments to make sure we're not saying anything they disagree with. Also attached is the Henning affidavit that supports the Mirant study. Although Mirant probably did not make the best choice in using an internal regulatory person to do the study presentation at FERC, everyone who I have talked to thinks that FERC staff reacted favorably to the study's findings. One person overheard FERC staff say that they expected $440 million in savings per year, and they weren't questioning these savings, but wondered if these were enough savings to justify a movement to one RTO. It seems to me that $440 million is significant savings, but who knows. Anyway, we need to discuss whether we want to join in the Mirant Midwest study. Provided that a similar study can be conducted in the midwest (since there are no ISOs there), with a similar good outcome, I think we should consider supporting the Mirant effort. Please let me know what you think. Thanks Sarah << File: Draft One RTO.DOC >> << File: Henning Aff Draft.DOC >> << File: Shanker Aff Draft.DOC >> ",

Board Meeting, we have prepared, and attach for your review, resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of Enron Corp. The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed. In addition, the interest rate and currency desk typically goes to Andy Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers. Andy's title has changed and he has also asked that Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts. The attached resolutions are substantially like the ones ENA has adopted in connection with the opening of brokerage accounts. ENA also requires two officers to sign documents to open brokerage accounts, but allows only one officer to sign subsequent documentation and to give instructions to the brokers. Would you please review the attached resolutions and advise if they are acceptable so that we can submit them to Rebecca Carter by tomorrow, August 1.

These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845. EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC. For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose. People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service. EIS bills services on a one month lag. We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee. This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information. Please examine these billings for accuracy. If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative. If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\". If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".",

        "clean_content": " skean.nsf Dear Steve and Bill, In case you have not already seen it, I thought you might be interested in the recent posting on a French website of an announcement of Andre LeGallo's departure from Enron and some commentary about the company's purported links to the CIA and the US political establishment. This website can be accessed at www.intelligenceonline.com. It is believed to be published by French persons with close connections to the French security services and also, reportedly, to Israeli intelligence. The website includes free content (of which this report was a part) and premium content available on a subscription basis only. The Andre LeGallo posting could reflect the purely detached academic/professional interest of the publishing entity. It is also worth considering that it would be a convenient document for one of your competitors to pass on to a foreign government with whom you might be negotiating, particularly if that government had elements or constituencies sensitive to the perception of links to U.S. intelligence. Please let me know if you would like any further information on this matter. Best regards Edward (INTELLIGENCE NEWSLETTER #376 - 17/02/2000) UNITED STATES : Enron Loses Intelligence Star The U.S. gas and electricity utility Enron has parted ways with Andre Le Gallo who was in charge of dealing with the group's most sensitive cases. A former CIA official known for his extreme discretion, Le Gallo quit the Houston-based company in January to open his own business intelligence firm, AJL Global Risks Solutions. His recent departure was known to only a few North American consultants. In his job as Enron's vice president for security, Le Gallo had worked behind the scenes on all of the difficult cases facing the group that required maximum confidentiality. Some believe his career with Enron served to underline the close links that reportedly exist between the company and the CIA. The first claims to that effect were made in the early 1990s when Kenneth Lay, founder and president of Enron appeared as a major financial backer of then-U.S. president George Bush. It was said Enron won favors from the American intelligence community, with the White House's blessings. One instance supposedly occurred in June, 1992 in India when Enron's local affiliate Dabhol Power Company won the right to operate on huge gas resources at Maharashtra near Bombay, in highly controversial circumstances. At the time, Indian political leaders suspected the American ambassador in New Delhi, Franck Wisner, of having asked the CIA station chief in the Indian capital to ensure Enron won the contract. A few years later, on Dec. 15, 1997, the same Franck Wisner was named a director of Enron Gas & Oil Co. In a further example of ambiguous links, the State Department is accused of also backing Enron in 1993 in negotiations for a contract to restore oil wells on the Shuaiba field in Kuwait that had been damaged during the Gulf War. Enron got the contract even though its bid was less advantageous than a lower bid submitted by Germany's Deutsche Babcock. The existence of ties between the former Bush administration and Enron can be seen in a new light in view of the coming presidential campaign in the U.S. According to a report by the Federal Election Commission, Bush's son --George W. Bush -- has already used an aircraft owned by the Enron company seven times since he began his race for the presidency.

I understand that our meeting with Jim Derrick and you has been rescheduled to the first part of March. Your assistant gave us the choice of March 1 or 2. Although we can accommodate both dates, March 1 works better for David Jackson. Our understanding is that Blakes is not getting any further work from Enron as a result of the circumstances under which we could no longer continue acting for Enron in litigation involving Westcoast, another Blakes client. As you can well imagine, the prospect of losing our valued relationship with Enron is extremely disappointing, especially considering the significant inroads we had made during the last couple of years in getting to know Enron, its various businesses and representing your interests on a number of major transactions and initiatives in Canada. At this point in time, we need to better understand where we stand and whether there is any prospect of representing your interests in Canada. One of our concerns in trying to mend fences is our relationship with your Calgary office which we perceive to be paramount in any effort to re-establish the kind of relationship we had with Enron prior to this incident. As a result, we would like to seek your views on this prior to our meeting in Houston so as not to further aggravate our relationship with the Calgary office. David Jackson and Jim Christie, two key members of our senior executive, and I would be available to discuss this matter with you at your convenience Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week.

        "clean_content": " dfarmer.nsf It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will have a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad array of industries. Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch. Since launch, we have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of over $25 billion. EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world. We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very specific reason. In addition to providing a web-based platform for transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the site. We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and sell at the posted price. This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typical eCommerce concept) into a true market. There are very few, if any, competitors that can provide this capability. We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies. If we are correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enron. Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this opportunity. Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a broad range of industries. It is likely that this business will ultimately be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution, wholesale, retail and broadband services. Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and success. To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchant functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadband. Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mike McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial Officer. These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron's Executive Committee. Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net Works. It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as an Enron global function. Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the development of worldwide technology standards and platforms. EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now be a part of Enron Net Works. The success of EnronOnLine enables us to utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the following individuals are included in Enron Net Works along with their current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Jay Fitzgerald, New Markets Identification; Bruce Garner, Metals; and Greg Piper, Pulp and Paper. Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational design and will provide full details on this exciting new business opportunity.",

        "clean_content": "Analyst presentation comments Cedric, As a follow-up to our meeting, below are a few comments and ideas regarding the Net Works piece of the analyst presentation. I know I sent you a lot of data and presentations, here are a few pages in the various presentations that I think may be appropriate for the presentation (or pieces of them) including: ? Why Enron? ? Recent Enron eCommerce Experience ? Lessons Learned ? Business Strategy ? Target Market Criteria ? Enron Today/Enron Tomorrow Here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas. We need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business (obvious). Clickpaper.com will be out and live just before the analyst meetings. This is very exciting and could take the industry by storm (eventually). Especially with Jeff's comments with the analysts. This should be emphasized with the metals piece. The concept is that here are 2 new areas where Enron is going to change the \"old economy\" businesses and industries. Clickpaper will have real time pricing which is different than all the other 15 existing sites. All of the others are charging 3% fees for matching buyers and sellers in a bulletin board or auction type of transactions. We will also have that functionality (and will charge 1% or $0 (we'll update you later) but will also have an EOL type of real time pricing component (this piece will be free). This piece will not be ready for July 25th but will be announced publicly and in final development stages (should be out by end of 3rd qtr.). I believe that the link with Net Works with both paper and metals is very important for providing a more complete picture than just metals alone. Also for your information, we are working on 2 acquisition deals that will be coming out soon, 1 is to buy a mill and could be announced next week, which will also clarify and add to the story since we will have access to physical pulp and paper. Paper must be an important piece of the presentation. Greg Piper is the MD for Clickpaper and he can answer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions. He can be reached at ext. 36635. Also, on the \"Target Markets\" page, I would reorder; put Lumber underneath pulp and paper and think about separating the others as potential markets. That way we could actually check off the top 3 as \"done\" and the others are in \"incubation\" and examination stages. Please draft up your initial thoughts on these items and send me the latest version and I'll add additional commentary. I will be in all next week. Thanks, mike ",

Letter Agreement for the Turbine Transaction (clean copy and blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the turbine letter agreement with Coral); 2. Letter Agreement for the Transformer Transaction (clean copy, blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the transformer letter agreement with Coral, and blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the turbine letter agreement referenced as item no. 1 above); 3. Limited Liability Company Agreement (clean copy and blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the LLC agreement for CA/ED-II). As mentioned on the telephone, I have retained a number of the representations and warranties requested by Coral, with modifications where necessary to eliminate those aspects which were objectionable to Enron. The justification for this is that nearly any purchaser would insist on such representations, and it is often more advantageous to present a draft that appears to be neutral, rather than allow the counterparty to focus on what is not there and then have the advantage of drafting precisely what it wants. Therefore, we suggest that Enron carefully review the representations and warranties in order that any objectionable items can be eliminated before circulation of documents to the counterparty. Because we rearranged and reorganized the representations and warranties to make a more clear presentation, the blacklined drafts will not be very helpful fur purposes of reviewing representations and warranties. Please review the enclosed at your convenience and advise of any comments. Thank you. Carolyn M.

Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission. Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors. New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming. In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses. All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation. Pre-Petition Expenses We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000. We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses. This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel. We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses. We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap. Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through. Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

What we have tried to do to meet your concerns is to see that ABB has a contract with a party which is as financially sound as Enron by adding the guaranty language. This addresses ABB's request that the party with the payment obligation have the \"financial wherewithall\" to make the payments. This is a big change from where we were in the last contract.

        "clean_content": " dfarmer.nsf It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen. We recognize that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron's business goals, and we are pleased that many of you have shared in the company's financial success through Enron stock options. As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program. Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron's continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package. On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program). It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, is as follows: ? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations. ? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.) ? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000. ? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant of stock options. Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program, among other good reasons=01( that's why. In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your questions, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your Human Resources representative. Note: In addition to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, granting of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron companies' employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refine the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

Just make sure you document it as described in this e-mail. P.S. There is no bigger matter to deal with than your bill. This must be the kind of half--truths that made you the most hated man in Sacramento. -----Original Message----- From: \"Michael Kirby\" <mlk@pkns.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Michael+20Kirby+22+20+3Cmlk+40pkns+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com] Sent:Wednesday, September 19, 2001 4:14 PM To:Sanders, Richard B. Cc:Annmarie Robertson Subject:Billings My accounting department advises me that back on April 27,2001, Enron apparently sent us a check for $54,585.11, which we received and deposited on May 7. The check included the payment of $28,087.71 for this firm (the exact amount of our February billing) and mistakenly included payment of $26,497.40 for one of Ed Kee's (PA Consulting Group) bills. That check was received after we sent our March billing and is thus not reflected on that bill. The full amount of that check showed up as a May 7 payment to us from Enronon our April billing, and reduced the outstanding balance by that amount. Whereas the total balance due shown on the April statement sent to Enron was $44,772.92, if the overpayment had not been made , the true balance due would have been $26,497.40 higher. Given the delay in sending our bills, andthe accumulation of additional time, there was never a credit balance on abilling to Enron, but the total balances due always included credit for the prior overpayment. We are about to send out our July billing today and our accounting department(Annmarie Robertson) got a call from Martha at Enron(345-4088) who realized what happened and asked for a refund check. We can and will obviously do that , but then we have to immediately ask Enron for that same amount-$26,497.40- because our prior bills would have been underpaid by that same amount. I am told that we cannot easily(if at all) go backand have the computer generate previous months' bills now with an unpaid balance when they were previously paid. My accounting department says it would be easier to just send out the July billing with a cover letter confirming that the $26,497.40 erroneously paid to us on May 7 has been credited in full to Enron, and is fully reflected in the total balance due. Hopefully this makes sense and I know we both have bigger matters to deal with. Can you approve us doing this or send us an email if Enron needs to get a check and revised billings. Thanks. .

(\"ENA\"). Ms. Bishop stated that she did not have any comments or changes to the Agreement, and that I should check with you for any changes. You stated previously that you did not have any changes - can you please confirm? We have received the fax of MARTA's outside counsel's legal opinion and have the following comments: 1. The first (introductory) paragraph references the date of the ISDA Master Agreement as June 1, 2001. The Agreement will be dated May 11, 2001, which is the trade date of the outstanding transaction between MARTA and ENA. 2. Since Thay Bishop is unwilling to request another resolution from MARTA's Board, the legal opinion should specifically reference the resolution dated April 23, 2001 that has been provided, and that such resolution is sufficient to grant the authority to enter into the ISDA Master Agreement and any related documents. 3. We request that Section 10 of the legal opinion be revised to add the following bolded language: \"No person, firm, corporation, entity or association other than Counterparty may liquidate, borrow, encumber, or otherwise utilize the assets (including, without limitation, the general operating fund) of Counterparty.\" If you can make these changes to the legal opinion, and if there are no changes to the ISDA Master Agreement, we can prepare the Agreement for execution.

        "clean_content": "EAMR Transactions This memo is being forwarded to you to address issues that have developed during recent Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) transactions and to establish appropriate procedures for going forward. EAMR, as you are probably aware, is an affiliate of Enron Transportation Services Company that performs services for third parties as well as other Enron affiliate companies. When EAMR enters into a contract with non Enron customers to deliver services, EAMR assumes all of the risk for any losses in the transaction Additionally, EAMR is not to be supported financially by the affiliated pipelines. All costs such as employee payroll expenses, travel and other related employee expenses, equipment usage fees, etc associated with an employee performing services for a customer under an EAMR transaction must be accurately recorded pursuant to prudent accounting procedures. Going forward, to ensure that there are no financial or contractual obligations that are not in the best interest of EAMR, the following process will be used on all transactions. 1) Cost estimates for services through EAMR will be sent to Sarabeth Smith in Houston for review and approval. Sarabeth will ensure that all costs and appropriate margins are included in the cost structure and then release it through a non-binding agreement for presentation to the customer by appropriate marketing personnel. Cost estimates, given to customers outside of this step in the process, run the possibility of having to be retracted due to the risk of committing EAMR to a transaction that is not contractually or financially sound. 2) It is the responsibility of every employee performing services for EAMR to be diligent in recording their time and expenses required to perform the services to the appropriately assigned project number. Monthly reviews of the expenses associated with each project will be conducted to ensure that all costs have been accurately recorded. Sarabeth will be the point of contact with the transaction originator, contract administration and legal to ensure draft agreements as well as the final agreement have been coordinated through all appropriate groups. Legal agreements will not be issued without proper sign-off of authorization. 3) All contracts must adhere to fundamental risk parameters set forth by management. These mandates are very clear concerning contract language and operating parameters for EAMR transactions. Your cooperation by adhering to the processes described in this memo is critical to the continued success of EAMR as a revenue generating entity as well as another \"marketing tool\" for the customer. Contact Information for EAMR will Sarabeth Smith at 713-345-5023, sarabeth.smith@enron.com, 1400 Smith 3AC-3147, Houston, TX 77002. Please pass this memo on to team members or other members of your staff that currently work or may work on EAMR transactions. Thanks for your support in this endeavor. ",

Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company.

The committee charters and memberships are set forth below. Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance. We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair. VP PRC The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.

Also enclosed are redlined drafts of each marked to reflect revisions from the initial drafts furnished earlier today. We believe that our revised description of the \"transaction\" in the Letter Agreement (which now provides that each event is a condition precedent to the other and is deemed to have occurred simultaneous with the other) should satisfy your concerns as to both the creditworthiness issue and the timing issue. At the closing, the signed Facility Agreement will not be \"delivered\" unless the loan is funded by Tejas. With respect to your concern about confidentiality, we have reviewed the confidentiality provisions of the master contract. One might conclude that the master contract does not expressly permit the disclosure of confidential information by Enron to prospective assignees, as a \"Permitted Assignee\" seems to include only an assignee who has received an assignment. On the other hand, it is arguable that there would never be any assignee without some disclosure, so that disclosure to prospective assignees must have been intended by the parties. Alternatively, query whether Enron's \"performance of its obligations\" under the master agreement could be construed to include using [and disclosing] confidential information in discussions with prospective assignees and their lenders, thereby permitting disclosure to Coral/Tejas under the second full paragraph of Section 21.1. Assuming that we can satisfy ourselves with respect to this issue, it then seems prudent to require Coral/Tejas to immediately execute a Confidentiality Agreement containing confidentiality restrictions comparable to those set forth in the master agreement. In the alternative, you may wish to revise the letter of intent (assuming it is to be executed momentarily) to include comparable confidentiality provisions. Please review the enclosed and advise of any additional comments. If we may be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to call. Thank you. Carolyn M.

        "clean_content": " louise kitchen 2-7-02.pst Overview Our bankruptcy filing requires a cultural change in the cash management procedures of Enron. Because of our fiduciary obligation to our creditors, wenow must move to centralized cash management. These new procedures will amend our prior policy. As management of the \"Debtor\", we should approach each decision about our business, including cash receipts and disbursements,from the perspective of, \"Does this enhance the value of the Debtor's estate?\" This memo addresses the new policies that are to be immediately implemented both for entities in the Chapter 11 reorganization and entities thathave not filed. There will be a meeting Wednesday, December 5, 2001 at 2:00 PM in the Board Room on the 50th floor to discuss the new policies. As a debtor-in-possession (\"DIP\"), we have new cash flow reporting obligations and we must develop and adhere to a cash flow budget. Failure to adhere could have serious consequences to our DIP financing availability as wellas diminish our credibility with the creditors with whom we must negotiateour ultimate exit from Chapter 11 as a reorganized entity. All Enron business units (not just the ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements because additional entities are likely to beincluded in the bankruptcy filing, and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the Company. There are special procedures outlined at the end of the memo specifically relating to the business units in bankruptcy (the Debtor business units). New Processes and Procedures Until further notice, a newly formed committee, the Cash Flow Management Committee (the \"Committee\"), will meet daily to review and approve daily payments and 5-day projections for each business unit. The Committee will be headed by George Wasaff and will also consist of Ray Bowen, Dave Gorte, Tim DeSpain, Bob Butts, Julia Murray and Lisa Mellencamp. The Committee will be assisted by our financial advisor, Batchelder & Partners and our outside counsel, Weil, Gotshal & Manges. The Committee will review payments only after approval by the business units. Business units remain responsible fortheir own internal approval processes. George Wasaff will be the Company's \"Cash Czar\". His responsibilities willinclude (i) a review of weekly cash budgets from all business units, (ii) presentation of weekly budgets to the Committee for approval, (iii) a review of daily disbursements for the current and immediately succeeding days and (iv) comparison of actual to budget variances for cash receipts and disbursements. As outlined in Rick Causey's memo of December 4, 2001, all business units must provide weekly cash flow projections. Each week's submission should beaccompanied by a sufficiently detailed explanation of any variances between budget and actual cash receipts and disbursements for the preceding week.Further details of the exact requirements and format of these projections will be provided at the meeting. All divisions must also provide rolling 5-day cash flow projections throughthe intranet system by 9:00 am each day. These 5-day projections must include a projection of all cash receipts and disbursements for the subsequent5 business days. Copies of all supporting documentation should be sent toGeorge Wasaff, Mary Perkins, and Tim DeSpain. Each business unit will be responsible for pre-screening weekly budgets and eliminating any non-essential payments. This projection should agree to weekly cash flow projectionsprovided on each Friday for the ensuing calendar week with variances clearly identified. By working with 5-day rolling projections, we can eliminatethe last minute scramble to assure that the payment is consistent with our situation. In order to be eligible for payment, items must appear on the weekly and daily cash flow projections. Failure to include on both will result in non-payment. Since our payments are subject to heightened scrutiny, our generalrule is that the practice of same day and manual wires will be discontinued. In addition, please flag any payments made to related parties as these may require separate reporting to the Court. Any questions on this processshould be routed to George Wasaff. Special Procedures for Debtors (Companies in bankruptcy) See the attached Exhibit A for a list of the current Debtor Companies. Additional companies may be added with each having its own petition date. As a general rule, we are legally prohibited from paying any pre-petition liabilities. The standard for what constitutes pre-petition is: ?Were goods delivered to Enron prior to December 2, 2001 (or specific petition date for entities filing after Dec. 2)? ?Were services provided prior to the petition date? ?If requests for payment are not clear, the business unit must contact vendors and request them to provide an invoice, signed by an officer, stating what portion of the goods or services were delivered pre-petition. ?If you are unsure or have any questions, please contact George Wasaff. You must segregate any pre-petition claims for payment. In virtually all cases these claims will not appear on the cash disbursement list because we are generally prohibited from making payment. However, the Company does have very limited authority to make payment to pre-petition vendors deemed tobe \"critical\". In order for a pre-petition disbursement to be approved, such disbursement must: (1) make sound business and operational sense; (2) be mission critical; and (3) there must not be a substitute vendor. The business unit heads will be responsible for ensuring that recommendations to the Committee for any disbursements to critical pre-petition vendors meet this test. The Committee's presumption will be that a vendor is not critical. If you believe that a pre-petition claim clearly meets the \"critical\" test, you may submit it as a clearly flagged item, stating your reasons for requested payment. The Committee and corporate management will consider these recommendations by the business unit. Internal Controls We need to reassess internal controls and determine if changes are required, especially in light of recent personnel changes. All internal controls, new and existing, will be subject to review by Andrew Parsons. He will be communicating with you regarding his assessment and requirements for any changes to be made. I look forward to seeing you this afternoon at the meeting. Exhibit A - Enron Entities that Have Filed Filed December 2, 2001 1.Enron Metals and Commodity 2.Enron Corp.

        "clean_content": " tjones.nsf THIS E-MAIL IS BEING RE-SENT AS IT HAS COME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT SOME OF YOU DID NOT RECEIVE SAME LAST NIGHT. The following are the comments of Macleod Dixon and RBC on the following documents: Enron Corp. Guaranty 1. The Guaranty in favour of RBC needs to apply to two confirmations (the commodity swap and the interest rate swap). The definition of \"Contract\" appears to apply to only one Confirmation. 2. There are some minor deficiencies such as an undefined reference to \"Beneficiaries\" in the definition of \"Subordinated Debt\" and the word \"and\" should be deleted from the beginning of the definition of \"Total Senior Debt\". 3. The limitation in Section 2.01 can be reduced to $250,000,000. 4. Please insert a representation in Section 3.01 that Enron Canada is a Principal Subsidiary. 5. The paragraph in Section 2.02 regarding reservation of set-off rights is too broad in several respects. Firstly, it should not apply to set-off claims held by any affiliate of the Guarantor (other than Enron Canada) and should be limited to set-off claims arising out of the Contract. 6. The address of RBC for the notice clause is the same as in the ISDA Schedule. 7. Is the last sentence in Section 6.08(d) meant to be a limitation and is it missing the word \"not\"? ISDA Schedule 1. Obviously there will now be only one Schedule and Party B will be RBC. The trustee non-recourse provisions can also be deleted. We assume that a single ISDA will cover both Swap 1 and Swap 4. 2. Section 2(c)(ii) should apply to all Transactions since RBC cannot as an operational matter accommodate netting between interest and commodity swaps. 3. Although the two Confirmations will be accepted at the closing, we should discuss the execution mechanism in Section 9(e)(ii) which contemplates that there is deemed immediate acceptance if RBC fails to accept the Confirmation after effective delivery. 4. Our understanding is that the transfer provisions would limit the transferees to North America (since any transferee must be in an RBC approved jurisdiction). 5. Our understanding is that the bilateral optional termination rights will continue to apply. We presume that the notice period will be relatively short (eg. 2 days). Also, there is a reference to the Calculation Agent in the last sentence of Section 6(f) which should probably contemplate the joint selection concept referred to above. In addition, why doesn't the joint selection of Reference Market-makers apply to any termination? 6. Our understanding is that collateral in the form of Letters of Credit will be required to be posted to cover any \"out of the money position\" by a party whose credit rating drops below BBB - .

The new DASH, the template of which should be completed early next week, would be prepared earlier in the process that was typically the case in the past, would contain a RAC recommendation, and would then be used as the approval document for the appropriate committee (Transaction Review or Bankruptcy Management) to recommend or approve a transaction. This is consistent with past practice (although presumably only business unit, RAC, and legal sign-offs would occur prior to committee review) and with your memo of earlier today. Your thoughts as to how the approval process should occur after a DASH is prepared would be appreciated. Regards, Dave ",

Deals initially entered into Sitara on the CES acquisition could not be utilized especially on CGAS for invoicing purposes. Thus Unify volumes were not used for these invoices / payments / netouts. P/L reports were instead utilized. In light of this information, there's a good possibility that actual volumes on deliveries, storage withdrawals / injections and netouts were not captured accurately in Unify/Sitara and so we don't show any receivables out there for CES. Our scheduler on CGAS, Joann Collins, has requested archived information from CGAS for CES volumes from January - March 2000. In the interim, as we discussed, we should definitely invoice and recieve payment from CES for the $$$ they want to pay us. Afterwards, we'll need to review our historical manual invoices and imbalance accounts with CES to see where we actually stand . Any thoughts??? THANKS",

Its easier to complete a project early and send out the info prior to the due date, then to have to go back and ask for more time. Depending on the size of the plant and location, we may be faced with a lot of checking equipment records and field checks to verify ratings.

Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video conference was set up with two locations: one at DOE in Washington and one in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage. It was tentatively set up for 2:30 pm CST. I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron. Long-Term Forward Contracts Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm. It includes a draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1. Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California. Debt and Forebearance Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday. QF Contract Reformation Parties continued discussion No information was available by COB Friday. Major Issues State interest in resolving State willingness to raise retail rates Utilties' desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager Willingness to \"call off the dogs\" for the suppliers and to release them from legal action State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation Next Steps If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting, this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the week of Jan 15. If agreement is reached, a massive amount of work is required immediately, such as: FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16. RFO completion and release by Jan 18 Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 2. Preparation of contract between utilities and state (probably DWR) Preparation of formal agreements among the parties on the terms on this settlement And more...",

The \"Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act\" is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton this week or next. Many provisions of the Act relating to the validity of electronic signatures will become effective on October 1, 2000.

        "clean_content": "Trinity Consulting Agreement Scott, for your review and comment, attached is a revised version of the Trinity Consulting Agreement that I have modified so that it more closely resembles our standard form of consulting agreement. Also, please note that our accounting group has also blessed this agreement. As a summary, the substantive changes that I made are as follows: - Article 1 now more specifically describes the standards by which Trinity will perform its services (these changes should be a non-issue) - Article 3 now imposes certain conflict of interest obligations on Trinity. 3.1 obligates them to represent and warrant that their entry into an agreement with us will not breach any other obligations that would otherwise have to other parties. 3.3 imposes the obligation on them to obtain our prior consent before they perform any work for any third party or government agency that would have \"an adverse effect\" on us (this is direct change from their form which had no such obligation but which is standard in our consulting agreements and is a reasonable request.) - Article 4 adds our standard language that Contractor is an independent contractor and not entitled to any of our employment benefits. - Article 5, inserted a 2 year term. - Article 6 inserted that payments are within 30 days and that reimbursements must be in advance. Please note that since I cannot edit the Price Schedule, then conforming changes to it need to be made, including whether to strike the 18% interest charge for late payments and whether to accept the 15% out-of-pocket surcharge (neither of which is in our standard agreement). I also inserted your name for invoices. - Article 7 added a termination event that the breach of the conflict of interest or confidentiality obligations is an immediate event of termination. - Article 8, inserted your name for notices with a copy to me in the legal department. - Article 9, I revised the liability limitation to make it reciprocal and excluded from the liability limitation, damages that would arise from Trinity's breaches of Section 3.1 (that entering into this agreement will not breach any other agreements that they have), Article 10 (indemnification for personal injury or death claims attributable to them), Section 12.2 (not providing us with information that violates someone else's intellectual property rights) and Section 13 (non-disclosure / confidentiality obligations). Note that although accepting a liability limitation is not standard per our agreements, by making the foregoing exceptions, the liability limitation that we are effectively agreeing to is only with respect to any \"malpractice\" claims that we would have against them if their work was not up to industry standards. - Article 10, this is an indemnification provision which obligates them to indemnify us for personal injury or death claims attributable to them. - Article 11, states that the ownership of work product developed will be ours and that they will not provide us with any information etc. that they do not have the intellectual property rights ownership of. - Section 13.4 are certain procedures to be observed in the event that a court requires the production of confidential information (the text is standard boilerplate.) - Article 14 states that they have all liceneses to perform the work and to the extent that any are needed they will obtain them at their own cost and expense. - Article 15 is our standard boilerplate. - Formerly Article 12 on Non-Solicitation of Employees - per our discussion this has been struck - Section 17.1 now imposes venue in Harris County, Texas not Dallas County. - Section 17.2 allows us to assign the agreement to any of our affiliates without their consent but subject to notifying them of the assignment - Section 17.8 requires our consent before they use Enron's name in any advertising - Exhibit A terms and conditions have all been struck since those duplicated what was in the Master Agreement.

        "clean_content": "October Volumes Hi Jackie, I ran a report from TETCO's system to show the volumes that Enron was allocated for the month of October, and some of the volumes are very different from the volumes that you show. I copied your numbers below and copied TETCO's volumes below that (with the disrepancies in red). I was wondering if you could double check the 3rd, 4th, 11th, 12th, 25th, and 27th to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than Enron North America at that meter. It looks like maybe the volumes that you show are the total flow at that meter, but I think that only part of the gas was actually allocated to us. I don't mind putting the allocated volumes in path manager, but I'd like to make sure that on the above days, I am only putting in the amount that Enron was allocated. Also, on the 6th and the 19th TETCO shows exactly half of what you show, which I thought was kind of strange. I am going to have to get TETCO's permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes you have requested, before I can put anything in Sitara or Unify. My manager is out of the office and will be back tomorrow, but I would like for him to double check the deal that we will have to create in Sitara for those two days, since we are dealing with a prior month issue.

THESE THINGS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND POSSIBLY CHANGED: Had Perlman's total numbers from today, which she did no subdivide into EA, EIM and EGM numbers. Made assumption that numbers from Sunday's spreadsheet for Beth's EGM and EIM totals stood, and backed into EA numbers by simply taking her total minus Sunday's EGM and EIM numbers. You will want to gut check this with Beth. Had Jenny's current total headcount (546) and her reductions to contractors and FTE's. Didn't have detail on her contractor versus FTE numbers after reductions. Just assumed 100 contractors, remaining FTE's. You will need to get that detail from Jenny to correctly reflect her Revised Headcount. There was a bust in numbers that I had for Commodity Logic Development. Gros gave me the starting number of 46 (contractors and FTE's - but without current breakdown). His reductions were 6 contractors and 8 FTE's, which should have left a revised total headcount of 32. But I wrote down a revised total headcount of 24 for this group. Off by 8, so I increased the number of contractor cuts to 14 to make the math work. Please go over details with Tom and make corrections as needed. Didn't have confirmed starting total headcount for ISC. Spreadsheet with his FTE names gives a count of 129, so I assumed that he has 50 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 179. Allan only reduced by 3 FTE's and if he plans to reduce contractors I did not have that info. So all other numbers for the ISC are simply forced. Please review with Allan and make corrections as needed. << File: HC Revision 11-20-01.xls >> Have a nice Thanksgiving with your families.

        "clean_content": "Canadian Retail Jim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within Enron Canada known as Enron Direct. In addition, EES has a Canadian entity, EES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some cross-border transactions in Canada. For various reasons, it has been decided to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob Milnthorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey. There are two legal/governance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you: 1. Governance: As a result, it will be necessary to make various corporate re-organizations to EES Canada. This will include having EES Canada established as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron Direct will have, its principal Canadian office. In relation to this, I was considering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada, with two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers. A few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related \"permanent establishment\" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada. Accordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of directors consisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me (as the senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups. I was thinking of doing likewise with EES Canada. Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate records for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are Jim and an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest McNee. I am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees of EES are designated as the officers of EES Canada. Would it be appropriate to re-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has been organized, or do you have concerns? 2. Law Firm: Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confirm that our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project was \"grandfathered\" on the basis that they were \"up the learning curve\" on a number of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation issues. There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada. Although I was not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute on some gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Toronto, Ernest McNee. However, as the focus of the business initiative in Canada will, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly, if not entirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in regulatory proceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues affecting the Alberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with the licensing and contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and given my understanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been relatively limited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young continue on with this matter. I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns, and therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter. I look forward to hearing from you. Regards, Peter ",

        "clean_content": "Excess OASDI Payments and Withholding Issue Sharon / Michelle / Kriste: The enclosed document addresses excess OASDI payment by Enron and excess OASDI withholdings from employees when U. S. domestic employee transfers occur between Enron BUs. The current situation results in significant Enron excess OASDI payment annually, and creates issues with employee due to overwithholding resulting in employee complaints and ill will towards HR, Payroll, and Enron. The document depicts apparent options, and a potential solution, to the current situation. This is viewed as an HR customer service issue to ensure Enron employees receive the best overall service possible in their interface to the HR function and systems. It is my understanding that Enron Executive Management feel that employee transferability among the BUs is important, and wishes to see more movement of employees (as well as thoughts and ideas) between the BUs in the future to enhance employee opportunities and Enron's value. This being the case, I would expect the Enron cost and employee impacts and issues to be acerbated as additional and increased employee movement occurs in the future. We need Legal review of the issues and opportunities as presented in the document to determine a solution to the current - and pending future - situation, and look forward to any guidance you can provide in resolving the problems the current situation creates for Enron employees who transfer between Enron entities within a tax year and to mitigate potential future issues. If there is not a Legal obstacle, we will then go to Tax to address the specific tax entity issues. Regards, Bob ",

        "clean_content": " jdasovic.nsf Hey, nice spreadsheet. Two minor questions: 1) Isn't the provision for taxes on the income statement actually the taxes on the 'income' they made from using the sales method (equal to 46%), rather than what they pay will actually pay the IRS under the installment method? I think the notes show how instead of paying the 4.1$ based on their recognized income, they pay some itty bitty amount based on installment. If so, I think they actually get a 46% tax break on the 1 million and change that they lose using a cash basis. Still a loss, just not so big. Anyway, I'm not sure if I'm thinking straight on this, but that's how I read the numbers. 2) Does the balance sheet have to change a little? For example, does shareholder equity change since the income that goes to retained earnings is now a loss, rather than a gain? Also, if revenue is recognized on a cash basis and is now much smaller, there needs to be another liability to equal out the decrease in revenues with the still large notes receivables on the asset side (as you note in the answer the notes recievables stays the same). Seems like they might need a liability like \"deferred profits\" or some such thing, such that the [\"deferred profits\" + revenues (recognized on cash basis)] notes receivables. Anyway, I may not have this right, but thought I'd bring it up to see what you think. Best, Jeff",

Could you please review this and add the appropriate legal language. I don't think that we need any Board approval for any of these changes, so is some type of notification sufficient? 2) I would like to address the idea of signature authorities other than Laura at the same time. My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that have been reviewed and approved by legal. If you can at least pull the template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful. 3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started. We can discuss this any time you want. 4) What is your availability tomorrow either 8-9:15 or after 3:00 to discuss the intercompany loan agreement, and will Heather be available?

At this time, the General Land Office is transporting their share of production (21.8945% interest) and HPL is purchasing the remaining 78.1055%. The GLO has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848, effective September 1, 2000. During this time, some test gas flowed. I have had the HPL purchase back-dated to coincide with the transport nomination, and have had both deals moved to 9862. The meter should probably be designated a Callout/Swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after the production month by Volume Management. For October production forward, I am going to re-rank/confirm the pay meter to ensure that the GLO receives a volume which should be close to their percentage after actuals close for the month. This should alleviate any large balance swings on their agreement. Anita: For September, I need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket 379424; HPL gathering agmt. at meter 9862. Please unallocate the transport and purchase at 9848. The meter is a daily swing right now. Let me know when you are ready and I will change the allocation methodology. I apologize for the length of this email, I want to make sure that we are all on the same page, to the extent that we need to be, prior to this deal getting too far down the road.

Please forward to me a copy of whatever you would like to send before you send it. Thanks, Dave Further to the recent queries you raised concerning the ETA, we can provide you with the following comfort. The final sentence of clause 2(d) preventsa Counterparty from claiming that the ETA has not been duly accepted or an offer has not been validly made or that a transaction has not been validly entered into solely by virtue of the electronic =01&click=018 method of submitting offers or execution. This same principle provides protection to you in that the only binding transactions upon both yourselves and Enron are the ones in which certain terms have been clicked upon by you and the same terms accepted by Enron through the automated EnronOnline process. The system is designed to ensure that the terms of the offer you submit are the only terms which can be accepted by Enron. As a result, there have been no instances in which a customer offered on one set of terms, but Enron accepted a different set of terms. ",

For the past several months,a project team, representing Enron's temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team's efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition. We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001. The scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two phases have been completed. Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we selected CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group based on their exceptional management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our staffing needs. The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective and simple means for obtaining temporary employees. In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group will be communicating to Enron's administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors about the new process. There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are outlined on the attached page. More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed Services team. What is Managed Services? CORESTAFF's Managed Services program includes: ? Vendor-neutral management model ? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners ? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized reporting ? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement ? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies Key Benefits ? More vendors working on each order from the outset =01) faster access to available talent pools ? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively ? Online access to requisition status for users ?

It was for deal #116542. There isn't anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that the File Room doesn't have anything either). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---- As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.

There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything else in the File Room).

For the past several months,a project team, representing Enron's temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team's efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition. We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001. The scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two phases have been completed. Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we selected CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group based on their exceptional management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our staffing needs. The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective and simple means for obtaining temporary employees. In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group will be communicating to Enron's administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors about the new process. There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are outlined on the attached page. More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed Services team. What is Managed Services? CORESTAFF's Managed Services program includes: ? Vendor-neutral management model ? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners ? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized reporting ? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement ? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies Key Benefits ? More vendors working on each order from the outset =01) faster access to available talent pools ? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively ? Online access to requisition status for users ?

        "clean_content": " Just so there's no confusion: I, too, have accepted a position with UBS Warburg to be a part of its regulatory affairs team. Alan Comnes -----Original Message----- From: Belden, Tim Sent:Thursday, January 31, 2002 12:01 PM To:DL-Portland World Trade Center Subject:Office Update Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and whatis likely to transpire in the weeks to come. I'd like to begin by apologizing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over thelast couple of weeks. These have been very hard times and I know that people have wanted information. It has taken us nearly a week to sort throughwho will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) who do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed. In addition to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have accepted positions with UBS Warburg: Last NameFirst NameLast NameFirst Name AmadorSusanOhJohn AndersonJohnPlatterM BulbesVictorPostlethwaiteJohn ChangFang-TzuRichterJeffrey ChattertonJillRobinsonDonald CrandallSeanSalisburyHolden CutsforthDianeScholtesDiana DasovichJeffSempergerCara DavidsonDebraSheidunDonna DeanCraigShieldsJeffrey DuntonHeatherSlingerRyan EtringerMichaelSolbergGeir GilbertMichael \"Scotty\"SteinerDavid GustafsonMollieStokleyMarlin \"Chris\" HallStephenSwainStephen HeizenraderTimothySwerzbinMichael KandaswamyBalachandarThomasJacob LackeyChristopherThomeStephen LeeEugeneVan HoutenMaria MalloryPatrick \"Chris\"VilleggianteTheresa McDonaldMichaelWenteLaura MeyerJamesWilliamsWilliam J MeyersAlbertWoodlandAndrea MierMichaelYoderChristian NelsonKourtney While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate. It is not entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power looks like for the Enron estate now. As I understand it, there are two primary initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.The first is the disposition of our development projects that are alreadywell under way. Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effort together with the Portland asset development team. This effort has been ongoing since December. The second is the disposition of our west power commodity positions. Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Richter, Ed Baughman among others. I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul toget advice on how people in Portland should proceed. I would recommend talking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction. I have placed a call to several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response. I am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinatethe power procurement and delivery efforts. As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron has already begun. People who will continue to work for Enron will be located on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor. We hope to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week. Moves withinthe 3rd Floor will take place the following week. The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hurdle. While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be onor about February 6th. Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperationover the last few weeks. These have been really horrible times as the Enron story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are finding out about their future with Enron and UBS. I know that this hasn't been easy for anyone. I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the awesome team that we have put together. Whether you are going to UBS, remaining with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on thisteam the best in their future endeavors. It has been a distinct honor to work with each and every one of you. Regards, Tim ",

        "clean_content": " tjones.nsf Gentlemen - Bob has asked me to forward revised versions of the Broker ETA and Fee Agreement for the BrokerClient product. Attached you will find marked versions of these documents. In making the noted revisions, I have relied upon the revisions forwarded to Bob on 3/21, Bob's notes of your discussions on 3/21 and discussions earlier today that I had with Bob. A few items to note: 1. Neither the BETA nor the Fee Agreement reflect changes allowing APB to enter into these agreements on behalf of affiliates or to assign these agreements. Since the access and use of the website is intended to be supported by the credit of APB, allowing APB to act on behalf of or to transfer its obligations to an unknown party would result in possible unknown (and possibly unacceptable) credit risk to Enron. 2. The provisions relating to Liquidated Damages are the corner stone of Enron's ability to recover from APB in the event a counterparty/participant fails to honor a deal that APB has executed. In order to have a liquidated damages concept be effective, the calculation of liquidated damages must be reflected in the agreement and not left to negotiation. 3. Currently, the website contemplates that each broker will sign - electronically - the BETA agreement contained online. Since we will be physically signing these agreements, there is no need to refer in the agreements to the online signing. There is, however, the need to address future online BETA agreements (modifications or amendments to current forms) and, accordingly, language surrounding this issue has been placed into the agreements. 4. We have provided for a quarterly payment of the Access Fee. While this is not consistent with the requested monthly payment, it is possible this will be acceptable to sr. management. Currently, this item is subject to final approval by Enron management. Please take a look at the attached at your convenience. As we would like to move this process along promptly, I understand Bob will contact you tomorrow to further discuss these matters. In the meantime, please feel free to call me with any questions or comments. Mark Senior Counsel, ENA Phone: 713-345-8897 Facsimile: 713-646-3940 E-Mail: Mark.Greenberg@enron.com",

Enron will seek opportunities to fill-in its businesses with asset purchases, rather than purchasing new businesses. It will be giving a detailed view of its telecommunications business at an analysts meeting in Houston today. Enron says Europe, Latin America's southern cone and Japan provide great opportunity. Enron's EnCom unit's recently teamed with the Japanese firm Orix to participate in the retail electricity sales business when the Japan market is opened, currently scheduled for this March. Enron plans to use EnronOnline as its vehicle to enter the European market. EnronOnline, the global Internet-based transaction system for wholesale energy and other commodities, will soon allow it to reduce back-office costs in a transaction substantially. In addition to being able to cut the $1,000-$1,500 per transaction as much as 80-90%, EnronOnline will create an environment where a buyer or seller of natural gas or power will be able to more easily, with a computer mouse click, process complex power and natural gas transactions.

This non-solicitation agreement is being required by Niagara Mohawk in order to participate in its request for proposal both to outsource the management of its supply portfolio and to provide power to meet its \"Standard Offer Service\" load requirements for a term ending 12/31/06. The proposed non-solicitation language reads as follows: \"The Interested Party [this is defined to be Enron North America Corp.] agrees that, without the prior written consent of Niagara Mohawk, the Interested Party will not for a period of eighteen (18) months from the effective date of this Confidentiality Agreement directly or indirectly solicit for employment any non-union individual who is now employed by Niagara Mohawk, its parent, or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries and who is identified by the Interested Party as a result of its evaluation or otherwise in connection with the Transaction; provided, however, that the Interested Party shall not be prohibited from (i) employing any such individual who contacts the Interested Party on his or her own initiative and without any direct or indirect solicitation by the Interested Party, and (ii) conducting generalized solicitations for employees (which solicitations are not specifically targeted at employees of Niagara Mohawk, its parent, or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries) through the use of media advertisements, professional search firms or otherwise.\" Please feel free to contact me at extension 3-7493 if you have any questions or comments on the legal side.

Currently, (with appropriate GC approval) we can specify United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in New York County (\"USDCSDNY\") or the Commercial Division, Civil Branch of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County. In-house counsel for Chase Securities Inc. would not accept this provision without a caveat that if a judge of the specified state court determined that some other branch or division of such court sitting in NY County should have jurisdiction, we had to accept jurisdiction in the other branch or division. Rather than risk ending up in an unacceptable forum, both sides agreed to limit jurisdiction to the USDCSDNY.

Also, do we do anything for the industrial volume? I think we ought to let people know that we accomplished this (albeit that we did this a long time ago). Please let me know. Ed asked me to find revenue from Entex for transportation expense to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential part of the contract (Transaction 10). After checking into it, we have all found the following things: 1. Howard allocates the Lufkin/Diboll meters (7107/8/9) based on actuals. 2. Howard receives allocations from Entex for the industrial volumes, and then backs into the Transaction 10 (residential) volumes for Lufkin/Diboll. 3. Howard allocates the residential piece for Lufkin/Diboll to Transaction 10. 4. Kyle bills Entex for the residential volume, and applies the cash to the sales invoice. 5. Cassandra cuts an invoice to Co. 16 to get reimbursed for the transport expense going up to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential volume. 6. The money lands in Ed's P&L for the residential piece of the transport reimbursement. Right now, at the end of the month, Eric Bass tells Mick how much the transport reimbursement is and Mick includes that money in Ed's P&L as revenue from a third party. The actual money is reflected in Co. 12, and we just have to make sure that the money is reflected as revenue for Ed in the G/L rather than for Tom. ",

        "clean_content": "New Paycheck Information! Introducing your first SAP Paycheck! This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of Corporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below. What's Different? ? Your =01+home' cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay advice. This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial modules of SAP. ? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P' represent earning types reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time for the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice as =01+PVacation'. ? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions will remain itemized in the deduction section. ? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-date totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your pay advice throughout the year. (Note that your W2 at the end of the year will reflect your earnings by company). ? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the related dollar amount will be included in the =01+Salary' earnings type. ? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555 Payroll FAQ's My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stand for? There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck. For some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to print. In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions and prints them on one line =01) titled =01&other deductions=018. The detail of all deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet at eHRonline.enron.com. What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean? These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll from the side index. Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck? Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected in the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice as =01+POvertime'. What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)? For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit is applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amount withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FICA will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return. What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock options? There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form requesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , select Enron Payroll from the side index). ",

It was reported at the meeting that the orders will find that it is necessary for a single Southeast region RTO. A separate order will be issued in a new docket RT01-100 initiating mediation before an ALJ (Judge Bobbie McCartney) to facilitate the formation of the single Southeast RTO. Within one week, the settlement proceeding will begin and will continue for 45 days. The judge thereafter must report to the Commission within 10 days including an outlline of a Southeastern RTO, milestones for completion of intermediate steps and a deadline for submitting a joint proposal. The Commission will review the report and may issue further orders as needed. Grid South, SE Trans and SPP are required to participate and Grid Florida is encouraged to participate in the mediation. All parties to any of these RTOs should also participate. The Grid South order will also include language requiring an independent board. After the independent board is established, it should choose an operator of the RTO. This language should further support the idea set out in a prior SPP order granting Enron's clarification that the RTO should not make major capital expenditures for software or operating systems prior to the establishment of an independent board. The Grid South order should also include language supporting the establishment of interconnection standards. ",

There are currently no controls in these rules against market concentration in the secondary market. While the unconstricted nature of the secondary market will facilitate more and new entrants in the capacity market, this fluid quality nevertheless creates a risk of concentration, insofar as capacity that was awarded in the initial Open Season may be assigned to any creditworthy market participant and without market share limits. Indeed, the Comprehensive Settlement does not provide for a mandatory electronic bulletin board for secondary market trades and, accordingly, tracking secondary market trades would be complicated and administratively infeasible. Nonetheless, the Commission should remain cognizant of the risk of market concentration and commit to respond to any such complaints raised by market participants.\" With all due respect, it is a rather transparent attempt to get the Commission to focus on on the secondary market issue. We agreed to exclude secondary market acquisitions as a measure of market concentration. The above paragraph signals the Commission that this is a problem and dilutes the value of the testimony. ",

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface. We believe that the business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP. I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below. Two Years Ago Today Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in place. Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of existence of signed agreement. Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time. Canada nets across counterparties. Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain separate net statement process. ENA considering netting physical and financial together. All account coordinators were to apply their own cash. Cash applied centrally in Power, Financial and Canada Individual coordinators apply cash only in physical Gas. Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team. Although gas settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by financial settlements. The company has not made any move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team. The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line tool. Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing data, rather than using the on-line functionality. Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed. Overpayments would be classified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system. Case management system does not exist. Allowing overapplication helps the account coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account. The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the counterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice. Given the number of legal entities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties have, this seems like a hopeless battle. Allowing cross-application of cash seems easier. Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash movement. Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash movement. Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways: Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face two problems in Unify. Controls built into Unify are already obsolete. Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) impossible. Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable within SAP. However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at the time of finaling a payment in Unify. To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to SAP AR. We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss. Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments. We WILL make this decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any additional time for consideration. Stephen ",

        "clean_content": "Status on Calpine Dighton I wanted to give you a quick update on this. After reviewing the various angles on this with structuring, it was evident that the best real prospect for doing something with them was for us to receive a below mkt position from Calpine off of Dighton (so as to force Coenergy (gas supplier) to make as large a termination pmt to Calpine as possible). In return, we would provide some other form of value (e.g., low cost capital to facilitate re-financing of Dighton once gas agreement terminated, we sell them a below mkt position in another region, etc.). I floated this proposal verbally to PaulBarnett about a 1-1.5 weeks ago, and his reaction was sort of \"that soundsinteresting\" but he didn't show a great deal of genuine interest. I indicated to him that I would work up a more specific written proposal. However, after discussing with our legal dept, they had some real angst of me making a formal written proposal to them in this regard (concerns centering around tortious interference, etc.). Based on that, I called Barnett back saying I was unable to make a formal written proposal along the lines of my verbal proposal to him, but that we would still be interested and indicated that the ball is in his court if he wants to pursue that angle. As yet I have not heard back from him, and i do not hold a lot of hope that they wantto pursue this. Kevin - please let me know if you think trying to chase this more makes sense based on your discussions with Paul P. a few weeks back. John",

Haedicke FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net Corporation HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm With everything in the \"Wexis\" universe always just a click or two away on the Internet, you no longer need to pick and choose resources and interestingly, you no longer necessarily require expensive subscriptions. Before the Internet you couldn't Shepardize for $4 or Keycite(r) for $3.75. You had to be a subscriber. Today all you need is a credit card. See, e.g.: http://www.westlaw.com/SubOptions/other.wl see also: http://web.lexis.com/xchange/Forms/uas/Catalog.asp In fact, everything published to http://www.westlaw.com and http://www.lexis.com is available on-demand whenever you cannot quickly find the right answer elsewhere for free, or for short money using TheLaw.net. Why is this significant and why would we advertise our competitors? Simple. For years, the management question has been whether to make that onerous annual commitment to Company A or Company B. But thanks to the Internet, you can have just what you need, at the precise time you need it on a pay-per-view basis. Choosing the right tool for the job is the trick. But that's easy once you know your options. --USEFUL BELLS AND WHISTLES OR TEDIOUS OVERKILL? TheLaw.net Custom Browser lacks some of Wexis' bells and whistles. For instance, using our meta-searchable database of four million plus Federal and state appellate judicial opinions, you can quickly call up a relevant list of cases that have construed the statute, rule, reg or cite that you need to learn more about. It is just as easy to quickly jump to the relevant excerpt of each case to assess relevancy. What's missing are the little colored arrows indicating whether a Court followed or distinguished your case. For some, the lack of every conceivable enhancement can be a deal breaker. Others, however, prefer to draw their own conclusions by checking cases for themselves because at some point in their career something happened which caused them to question whether the best lawyers are the ones still writing headnotes. Depending on the job at hand, the mind numbing array of costly, high falutin' Wexis icons and symbols scattered throughout a document, may be very useful or very confusing and unnecessary. --THE INTERNET: AN INCUBATOR FOR CHOICE We advertise our competitors because we recognize that Wexis has been a work in progress for generations and we know that you will probably always have a relationship with them at some level; subscription, pay-per-view, or otherwise. Certainly, factors such as practice area, jurisdiction, organization size and culture all contribute to assembling what is, for you, the best matrix of tools for the job. Far be it from us to say precisely where we fit in. This, by definition, is an individualized decision only you can make as a sophisticated consumer of information services. Experience teaches, however, that by deploying TheLaw.net in your world: ----you may discover that your online productivity increases ten fold ----the list of expensive subscription items may be much shorter ----you may discover that it makes sense to use Wexis only a transaction basis We have subscribers who will tell you that this is a great way to run a business. Clients' expectations are set at the front end. You recover 100% of your costs on the back side and the embarrassment of finessing or eating unanticipated charges are added to what we hope is a long list of learning experiences. See, e.g., http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm General practitioners frequently see us as a sensible, low flat-rate go-to resource and when necessary, they supplement with Wexis. Specialists sometimes choose to cling to their elegant practice or jurisdiction specific slice of Wexis, adding us on as \"meter insurance\" for those occasions when The Plan doesn't cut. All seem to recognize that TheLaw.net has indeed developed the definitive best practices software solution for getting around online; a solution that allows you to instantly begin leveraging tens of thousands of critical web based documents and databases on behalf of your online enterprise. --A FIRM FOUNDATION AT A LOW, FLAT-RATE --------$395 annually for you --------$575 for you and a partner --------$1195 for your five-user workgroup --------Unlimited access to everything we have --------30-Day Unconditional Money Back Guarantee --------Enterprise Licenses are also available.

These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now. After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the \"changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November\". As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear. These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24. Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights. I look forward to hearing from you, Regards, Diomedes Christodoulou.",

Nolan was overly cautious and at times evasive.? The highlights of the day were as follows: --Nolan did not see the offering memo until he reviewed it on the way to Thailand in April '98.? Nolan was not privy to any discussions or road show presentations regarding the Notes prior to the closing (When Nolan was confronted with communications between himself and Serge Deslise of NSM in Jan. '98, he claimed he could not recollect why he would be communicating with NSM prior to the closing). --When Nolan arrived in Thailand, he found a mill that appeared to be state of the art, but lacked raw materials and funds to produce steel. --Nolan soon found that the Mill had serious engineering and management problems. --NSM had no financial controls until Aug. 98 when Stickler instituted a policy of requiring two signatures on disbursements. Kathy spent a good deal of the day on an e-mail \"situation report\" sent by Nolan to Busse in May '98 discussing numerous problems with the Electric Arc Furnace, the Degasser and other parts of the mill. Enron/ECT came up during the early portion of the deposition.? Patrick asked Nolan if he recalls discussing any aspect of the Mill with Brian Barth.? Nolan said he could not recall.? Patrick then asked him if he thought? Barth was an honest and competent person.? Nolan answered affirmatively.? It appears that Kathy is trying to lay the foundation for information she received from Brain during her interview. If Kathy continues focusing on Brian, however, it may begin to appear quite obvious to the other defendants that she has received information from Brian.?

Mr. Bailey, Mr. Bongartz-Renaud, Mr. del Missier, Ms. Genova, Mr. James, Ms. Mandell, Mr. Moulds, Mr. Oakley Mr. Pickel and Mr. Steve volunteered for this review. 4. Board members agreed to determine if their institutions could assist the Association in its technology acquisitions by obtaining a volume discount. There are certain purchases of computers, which we propose to buy from Dell, that we have budgeted for this year and plan to proceed on. If you have a relationship with Dell that we could rely upon, please let me know as soon as possible.

I know you are in the process of getting the NDA completed, but I don't want our progress to be held up by the legal process. In our last meeting, there were several documents shown that you had not seen in the past. Attached, you will find the documents you requested. Business Model Overview The \"business model.ppt\" file contains the slides describing how iGeneration is creating web professionals and the web job role certificatons/skill sets. Please let me know if you have any questions. Project Manager Resource As an enterprise partner, an Project Manager will be assigned to Enron. This person is a resource of iGeneration and will be responsible for implementing the solution. The \"project manager.doc\" file should provide you with an overview of the project manager's roles and responsibilities. Pricing Model The \"iGeneration TalentLink Pricing Grid.doc\" will outline standard pricing and features model. Please keep in mind, the pricing model does not account for training, so modifications will have to be made as we progress. Skill Set Analysis We have reveiwed all of the web related job reqs listed on Enron's career web site, and aligned them to iGeneration certifications. It is quite compelling how the two align. I look forward to sharing this information with you. I know you wanted to see a detailed version of our certification skill sets. The files are quite large, so I only included a couple. Please let me know if you would like any more. If there is additional information you would like to see, please let me know. I will call you on Friday to discuss scheduling our next meeting.

Friedberg explained that the Ohio counsel are \"classic plaintiff's lawyers\" - they are not that familiar with the issues and will tend to ask broad generalized questions.? Friedberg also noted that they may be unaware that Enron is a defendant in the two California actions and will likely be unaware that Enron is the only defendant who has not cross-complained against Schultes. For purposes of insuring that any deposition testimony in the Ohio case is not used against any defendant in the bondholders' litigation,? Friedberg thought it would be a good idea to try a limit any discussion to post-closing events and, more specifically, whether Enron personnel were privy to any discussions with SDI or McDonald regarding (1) the decision to fire Schultes, (2) Schultes' alleged dishonesty and (3) Schultes' alleged incompetence.? Friedberg explained that Busse's defenses to the defamation and wrongful termination claims are (1) that he did not make any defamatory statements and (2) if he did, they were true.? The problem with the second defense is that it may affect our defenses in the bondholders' litigation.? If Enron or others were aware that Schultes was dishonest or incompetent it will be important to know when and how they learned of such information.? Ideally, they learned it after the closing and only through discussions between McDonald and SDI. This e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential information.

These 20 employees have developed four packages of gathering assets in the Powder and Wind River Basins in the state of Wyoming. In 3 out of 4 of the packages it is a fractional ownership situation where NBP will not control the gathering company. NBP wishes to acquire these asset packages and the 20 people who presently manage them. The 20 individuals perform the following functions (1)Finance and Structuring (2)Commercial Development and Asset Management (3) Engineering and Operations (4) Deal Origination. The natural gas gathered by the subject gathering assets finds its way to market using the following interstate pipelines, Trailblazer, CIG, Kern River, and to a limited extent, Williston Basin, Kinder Morgan and MIGC. In numerous situations the gas will be purchased at the wellhead by ENA and transported through gathering systems to be owned in whole or in part by NBP. Those individuals who approve the purchase of the wellhead gas (and determine the pricing) are not included in the 20 employees who would come to work for NBP. ENA and NBP do contemplate future joint venture projects where ENA would buy and sell gas and NBP would build gathering systems. It is proposed that the 20 employees, located in Denver and led by an officer located there will be employees of a division of Northern Plains Natural Gas Company (a wholly owned sub of Enron and operator of Northern Border Pipeline Company). It is not intended that the 20 employees ever have duties with respect to the management or operation of NBPL. It is proposed that the Denver officer would report to the President of Northern Plains and the Chairman of NBP (Currently Larry Deroin). THE QUESTION: Do the FERC's standards of conduct regarding marketing affiliates impose restrictions on the deal as described or the individuals proposing to come to work at NPNG on behalf of NBP. If so, please describe the restrictions and suggest improvements in the proposed structure. ( Assume as a given that the 20 employees want to remain within the Enron family of companies.)",

If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read, copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify the sender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system. Thank you. _______________________________________________________________ These are my comments re the draft Petition forwarded by Peoples on Friday: (1) The Petition describes PERC in paragraph and refers to PERC in par. 3. PERC, however, is not a party to the Master Agreement, and the Petition does not discuss request any relief with respect to PERC. I don't see why there is a need to reference PERC. (2) It is my understanding that, under the Master Agreement, there will be two types of transactions: (a) simple buy/sells at a clear market price; and (b) complex transactions with sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures. As we have discussed, the first type of transaction, simple buy/sells at a market price fall under an exemption to Section 7-101's approval requirement (220 ILCS 5/7-101(4)). These types of transactions do not require ICC approval and MEH/Peoples are free to engage in such transaction now. I would suggest that the Petition point this out, particularly if (as I suspect is the case) MEH and Peoples are now conducting such transactions or may wish to do so before the ICC acts on the Master Agreement. Because the Master Agreement covers certain transaction which need approval and other which do not, I would suggest that the Petition make this clear and request approval only \"to the extent required\". (This was the language used by NIGAS in seeking approval of a buy/sell agreement in Docket 95-0302.) (3) With respect to the transactions which do require approval (the complex ones with sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures), the draft Petition doesn't say much. It says (Par. 5) that transactions under the Agreement will optimize the use of the gas supply and capacity assets of Peoples and MEH; (Par. 9) that Peoples has similar master contracts with non-affiliated entities; (par. 10) that the agreement will not interfere with Peoples' operations; and (par. 10) that the Agreement is in the best interest of Peoples and its customers. All of these statements are fine to include, but the ICC is likely to want to know more about why the agreement is in the public interest. Perhaps a sentence or two could explain how the Agreement will optimize Peoples' use of its gas supply and capacity assets (e.g., by using capacity which otherwise would be idle) and how this will benefit Peoples' Illinois ratepayers (e.g., a credit to PGA gas costs). Also, Peoples is asking that the ICC pre-approve an arrangement under which the \"details\" of individual transactions will be filled in later. As I understand it, the \"details\" will include such things as the level of management fees and other compensation terms. To facilitate approval, it would be best to have some sort of guideline to suggest to the ICC, i.e., a management fee within a certain amount or percentage of a specified index level. If there is an industry standard approach that could be referenced, that may be of use. The Petition suggests that there are other Agreements of this type with non-affiliates. Perhaps reference could be made to pricing provisions under one or more of those agreements. If it is not possible to be any more specific, I am concerned that the ICC may want to wait and review individual transaction rather than giving blanket approval without knowing more. (4) The ICC approval process can take 4-5 months (sometimes more) to complete. The required approval time, however, can be cut down significantly when the apprval filing includes a Peition and supporting testimony that lays out all the information needed to conclude that a proposed arrangement is in the public interest (the interest of Illinois ratepayers). The Petition itself need not include all the details (it need only lay out the case ingeneral terms). A filing package which, with accompanying testimony, tells the full story will expedite the approval process.",

This is our highest response to an all Enron employee survey - ever. In exchange for your candid feedback, we want to provide you with an overview of the results for our company. We realize that you and your management have been working hard to build on our strengths and improve in areas of concern for us. The results reflect your substantial efforts. As you can see from the chart below, thanks to the increased focus on these issues provided by the Vision & Values Task Force and your efforts to improve communications, we have made significant progress.

Bob Butts will review the accounting implications of changing the SIC Code to 6211 and will supply a breakdown of revenues by segment to re-look at the SIC Code classification by Tuesday, March 6th. 2. Chris Dowd at CIC (our proxy solicitor) will work with Paula to gather the necessary information in order for CIC to present us with the probability of shareholder approval with a \"For\" vote and with an \"Against\" vote from ISS. He hopes to have this completed by Friday, March 9th. 3. Re-review the appropriate SIC Code and the next steps as it relates to contacting the SEC. 4. Once steps 1, 2 and 3 are completed, determine the number of shares to be requested via the final proxy. Final Draft of the proxy will be circulated on March 12th and will be filed with the SEC on March 20th. A document summarizing the Pros/Cons of keeping SIC Code 6211 is forthcoming once Paula has reviewed. As always, if you have any questions please give me a call. Mary",

You advised that Exmar, the disponent owner of the M/V SANTA CLARA, has made a demurrage claim against EGLI, who fixed the charter with Exmar, of approximately $165,000, arising out of the loading of a cargo of propane on the ship in March of 1991. You also advised that EGLI has a counterclaim for recovery of deadfreight in the amount of approximately $150,000. This matter has reportedly been only sporadically active over the many years since the claims were made, and is now ready to be set for an arbitration date. You mentioned that Exmar's attorney had been unresponsive to your suggestion that the parties just drop their respective claims. I understand that you feel this may be due to Exmar's attorney, rather than his client. You further mentioned that you have read that some Enron entity is or has in the recent past entered into charters with Exmar. It makes no sense for Enron and Exmar to pursue this matter further, given what you have told me. My plan is to confirm that Enron has in fact a business relationship with Exmar that would allow us to go forward with a \"drop hands\" settlement. If you retained the publication in which you read about the recent charters, I would ask that you send it to me immediately. Since I don't yet have the file from my clients, please also send me the correct spelling of Exmar's name at your earliest convenience. By copy of this e-mail, I am asking everyone who I can think of whether they know if any Enron entity has (or has had in the recent past) a ship under charter to Exmar. If one of you can suggest other names I might check, please let me know. I would like to put this old dog out of its misery before year end if it is humanly possible to do so. Britt",

Resolutions of sole member of Salmon Energy LLC authorizing the turbine acquisition and related documents; 2. Incumbency Certificate of ENA for the escrow agent; and 3. Incumbency Certificate of PPL for the escrow agent. The resolutions authorize the turbine contract, the loan from PPL, and the G/E consent and agreement. I have also drafted resolutions to be dated the day following closing to elect as directors the persons named in the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement (need the names of these persons - three designees of PPL and one designee of ENA) and to replace the officers of the LLC with persons designated by PPL. If the lender desires Salmon resolutions authorizing a security agreement to be signed by Salmon, we would recommend that the new Salmon board controlled by PPL sign resolutions ratifying and approving the security agreement, rather than have ENA approve a security agreement that it has not negotiated and is not familiar with. From a timing standpoint, we need to focus on the documentation required to set up the escrow account, as I understand that the escrow may be funded on the same day as the financial closing, namely, Thursday, April 19. Citibank will need (I) the escrow agreement, (ii) an incumbency certificate from each party to the escrow agreement, (iii) a W-9 signed by each non-corporate party to the escrow agreement, and (iv) a signed fee agreement. The incumbency certificates are enclosed. Please insert names and other information as appropriate. We need comments to the Escrow Agreement in as soon as possible in order that we can provide these documents to Citibank for approval. Thank you. Carolyn M.

Please let me know if my e-mail distribution list is missing anyone who would like to participate in the subgroup. I would divide the immediate tasks before us into four main categories: 1. General Governance Issues (Especially RTO Membership, Board Composition and Technical Advisory Committee Issues) At the Governance Workshop on June 15, we had a good discussion of issues relating to the appropriate number and scope of membership classes, board composition and method of selecting the members of the Technical Advisory Committee. Barney Speckman is in the process of scheduling a meeting in early July for a continuation of discussion of these topics and any other governance issues that may be of interest. 2. Board and Employee Conflict of Interest Provisions/Board Member Qualifications One element of the RTO bylaws that will require a fair amount of thought and discussion is the appropriate nature and extent of the trustee and employee disqualification/conflict of interest provisions. Another such element is the required qualifications of the RTO board members. John Buechler of the New York ISO has prepared for us a good summary of the board member qualifications that have been adopted or are under consideration by various existing or proposed ISOs, and Barney Speckman will distribute copies of John's summary to the group. I would like to have a discussion of these issues at the next meeting, with the aim of preparing and circulating one or more straw man proposals as soon thereafter as possible. 3. Consideration of Jurisdiction of Incorporation/Conforming Revisions to Bylaws IndeGO was proposed to be formed in Utah, in large part because Utah's nonprofit corporation law was determined as of three years ago to contain the most favorable provisions for trustee indemnification of any state in which IndeGO was proposed to operate. RTO West, the nonprofit corporation that is serving as the vehicle for our RTO in formation, was incorporated this spring in Washington in large part on the strength of Washington's provisions for indemnification of nonprofit corporation trustees. Our subgroup needs to review the laws of the states in which RTO West would operate, and come up with a recommendation as to whether consideration should be given to incorporation of the RTO in any state other than Washington. Once a determination is made as to the appropriate state for incorporation, the bylaws will need to be conformed to the requirements of that state's nonprofit corporation law. Anyone who is interested in helping out on these fronts is most welcome. 4. Potential RTO Application for Tax Exemption The California ISO has been qualified for exemption from federal income tax, and a determination needs to be made whether such qualification would be appropriate for RTO West as well. Our subgroup has been given the task of identifying the relevant considerations to be taken into account in making the determination whether to seek tax-exempt status. Robb Roberts and Sanjiv Kripalani have expressed interest in helping to undertake this analysis. If any of the rest of you is interested in participating, please let me know. I will be out of the office for the next week-and-a-half, but will be checking voice mail and e-mail regularly. I look forward to seeing you all soon. Eric Eric E.

Letter Agreement for the Turbine Transaction (clean copy and blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the turbine letter agreement with Coral); 2. Letter Agreement for the Transformer Transaction (clean copy, blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the transformer letter agreement with Coral, and blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the turbine letter agreement referenced as item no. 1 above); 3. Limited Liability Company Agreement (clean copy and blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the LLC agreement for CA/ED-II). As mentioned on the telephone, I have retained a number of the representations and warranties requested by Coral, with modifications where necessary to eliminate those aspects which were objectionable to Enron. The justification for this is that nearly any purchaser would insist on such representations, and it is often more advantageous to present a draft that appears to be neutral, rather than allow the counterparty to focus on what is not there and then have the advantage of drafting precisely what it wants. Therefore, we suggest that Enron carefully review the representations and warranties in order that any objectionable items can be eliminated before circulation of documents to the counterparty. Because we rearranged and reorganized the representations and warranties to make a more clear presentation, the blacklined drafts will not be very helpful fur purposes of reviewing representations and warranties. Please review the enclosed at your convenience and advise of any comments. Thank you. Carolyn M.

Seller must move to another interface (either on Cinergy's border (NIPSCO, LG&E, AEP. . .) or in Cinergy's control area (Wabash) at which Buyer can receive energy such that energy can sink in Cinergy. Seller can require Buyer to purchase Non-Firm transmission (or Firm, if available) but each party will be responsible for any additional transmission costs incurred to reschedule to another delivery point. Ex #2 3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's notification and receives response that Firm is available. Buyer purchases Non-Firm instead. Entergy is sinking in Cinergy. Ex #3 3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission from Cinergy within 30 minutes of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.

        "clean_content": " joe parks 6-26-02.pst Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas. Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30. We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy. While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses. The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy. It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts. We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas. Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services. Ken Dear ETS Colleague: On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy. In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas. Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved. The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court. For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business. Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas. Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS. Keep up the good work! Stan",

Of course, this presumes the Agreement has value (of course any value is depleted by the opt-in provisions of the Telecommunications Act). If I know where your going, I don't think a security interest would overide Verizon's right to approve the transfer of the Agreement to a third party (except maybe in bankruptcy). However, the only conceivalbe reason I could see Verizon objecting to a transfer is, for example, the parent guaranty or self-insurance provisions -- depending on the nature of the transferee. >>> \"Leibman, Lara\" <Lara.Leibman@ENRON.com> 11/06/01 11:25AM >>> Al, With regard to the discussion that we had concerning assignment, please let me know your interpretation of the following clause in Verizon's Level 3 assignment language: \"The forgoing shall not be construed to prevent a Party from granting a security interest in this Agreement.\" I'm curious as to how this jives with what you told me about the stock vs. asset scenarios -- i.e., if someone buys our stock, we don't need to do anything vs. if someone buys our assets, legally we need Verizon to agree to transfer the contract to the buyer (but practically, Verizon has agreed in the past to do this on an informal basis). Like you, I would prefer to leave this alone for now until we absolutely need Verizon to insert some language in the agreement that covers the particular scenario that may evolve shortly. Thanks.

The majority of these imbalances are expected to be resolved with November close and the remaining imbalances should be cleared by year-end.

The changes from the last draft of 3/20 are reflected in the updated draft of 3/22 where in the prior changes have been incorporated and the two items identified below have been addressed. The final documents incorporate the new changes. The two items that were addressed were: 1. The change in Paragraph 3(e) of the BETA from 48 hours on the LC notice to two (2) business days. 2. In Paragraph 3(f) of the BETA and on Page 2 of the FA, language has been inserted to address the view only status until the LC is delivered to Enron. Other than these, there were a couple of minor clean-up changes (e.g., inclusion of \"Date:\" above both of Amerex's signature blanks and deletion of unnecessary spaces between paragraphs). Presuming all is in order with the attached, please have two originals of both the BETA and FA printed and signed by Amerex. These originals, together with the first installment of the Access Fee, should be forwarded to either me or Bob for counter-signature by Enron.

The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action lawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation). The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm. What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a shareholder derivative lawsuit. What this means is that the plaintiff shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on behalf of i2. The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions. What is interesting is that all damages recovered would go to i2. So why the lawsuit? The Plaintiff can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit. Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of \"tag-along\" type of action. The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit on your behalf. Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm try and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate time, i.e. client meeting, during a speech. Please let me know if you would like for us to accept service on your behalf. This is very common practice. I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit. Needless to say, you are indemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you and i2 does have insurance to cover this matter. Please let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your behalf. Thanks Bob Donohoo Corporate Counsel i2 Technologies, Inc.

The only document left outstanding which the legal team is busily working on for completion [today hopefully?] is the EPC Contract. Starting on Monday, the legal team needs to begin the closing due diligence process. Given that we thought we had a great call with GE this week and got at least S&S's signoff on consent letter, we haven't heard from anyone. This is UNACCEPTABLE since it puts not just TurboPark but all the deals relying on TurboPark in jeopardy!

I believe that the meeting is being set up for Wednesday. I can see how it is imperative that the General Counsels be at the meeting, although I am sure I do not control the invitation list. You may want to talk to your business heads. With this schedule, we are to have a good set of disclosure schedules by that date. The latest plan contemplates circulation of the revised purchase and sale agreement and draft disclosure schedules by Monday night.

Jerry also says that Staff has inofrmed Peoples informally that it is (apparently strongly) opposed to approval of the filing. Jerry says that Peoples is considering whether to withdraw its Petition for approval. As I understand it, this depends on whether there is a way to pursue transactions with enovate without a need for approval (presumably under the \"market price\" exception to the approval requirement.) I suggested that it may be preferable to wait until Staff files its testimony (explianing its position) before making a decision about withdrawal. Jerry says Peoples' concern is the additional disocvery which may be conducted. As I understand it, the case is being discussed internally at Peoples.

If that does not tell the story you are trying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on Nov. 1. I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan. However, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at 9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5, or sooner, if possible. I will need to make books and have them copied prior to the Lay Reviews on November 8. On Nov. 1, please bring a copy for Stan, Rod, myself and a few extras.

        "clean_content": "DealBench As most of us have discussed, Harry Arora's group has been developing an e-commerce site now known as DealBench.com (formerly EnronDirectFinance). This site is being launched as an information dissemination/deal platform whose closest competitor is Intralinks. DealBench's customers will be banks, law firms, and other businesses who desire a secure internet platform to conduct business transactions online. Customers will license use of the site pursuant to written agreements. Several trademark applications have been filed by Enron Corp. for the site. Lawyers from Vinson & Elkins in Austin (Bob Baird and Dean Harvey) and Houston (Steve Borgman) have been assisting us in various legal matters relating to the site. At this point, the commercial team desires to move ahead with a limited liability entity to own and operate the DealBench business. Based upon input from many of you, the proposal is to form a simple, single-member, owner-managed Delaware limited liability company named DealBench L.L.C. The sole owner would be Enron Net Works LLC. Upon formation, all assets and liabilities of the DealBench business will be assigned to, and assumed by the new LLC. We understand that the private placement being contemplated by Net Works will be through a separate legal entity and currently does not contemplate the DealBench business. We also understand that DealBench's ownership by Net Works will not preclude future flexibility in DealBench's ownership. The commercial team desires to move forward with formation of DealBench L.L.C. this week. Based upon your input, we will proceed as outlined above. If you have any other thoughts or suggestions, please let me know. Thanks for your help. Regards, NJD ",

        "clean_content": "storage clarification & issues Colleen, Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions, please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron. Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an in-person meeting down in your office. 1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated. In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change. 2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing mechanism and then apply it consistently. 3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to handle this production. 4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000 invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over, and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also, Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received anything. 5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we can't seem to find the right person over there. Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know. Thanks, Melissa ",

        "clean_content": " Beck, Sally.pst TO: All EGM and EIM employees affected FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations Last fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling. All wholesale companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella. In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers. This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well. With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses. Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works. Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks. Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed. To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM employees and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under company 083E. Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes. This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure. There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over. This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001. Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual. The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding. Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding. Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes. You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions. We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams. If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated: Business Unit HR Contact Phone# EGM David Hill 713/853-4218 EIM Kathy Neal 713/345-7803 EA/Global Services Frank De Jesus 713/345-3662 EA/Global Services Hector McLoughlin 713/853-6703 Thanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of Enron Wholesale Services.

Randy Baker & Michelle McLendin (Duke), and Lisa Grof & Frank Hilton (AEP) have volunteered to work on the on the credit annex subcommittee. According to my notes, assignments for the remaining optional provisions are as follows: 1) Incorporating old trades - Elizabeth 2) One-way transactions - Buddy 3) New products e.g. Western Firm/CAISO - Dede & Elizabeth 4) Regulatory Out - John Crespo & Randy Osteen 5) New taxes - Fritz 6) ADR - Patty 7) Agency relationship - Elizabeth 8) Electronic Exchanges - Babak Additional provisions 9) Credit Annex - Bill McCoy, et al. 10) incorporating prior trades not under netting, Frank Stllingwerf 11) Broker Confirmations ? 12) Over Deliveries - Phyliss Lemel What kind of deadline for these assignments is realistic? Randy Osteen & I plan to meet next w/ week to start planning the workshop in Atlanta we plan to hold at the end of January. If anyone has ideas for the program please let us know. I plan to fix up the contract web page next week Sterling Koch of TransAlta said he would like to set up a presentation opportunity for an EEI contract representative to talk to the Canadian standardization group.

We don't have your earnings meeting today and I am not sure yet if it is going to be later in the week ( when I am out of the office ) so I thought I would give you a heads up on a deal we are working on . It is early days and there are some significant accounting and timing issues , but we believe that we have found a way to reduce our cost's going forward and recognise potentially up to $100million of earnings . In brief this will be by unwinding a liability in respect of an existing swap for about $100m less than it will cost to settle the swap and pay out the third party debt and equity holders and pay breakage costs . It will involve us in taking back some incremental risk and in taking approx $230m of debt on balance sheet -I believe this is all manageable . In addition the transaction will require third party consents which could take time , however we are aiming to close Q2 . We will brief Glisan and Causey today as we need some support from them on a couple of issues . This is not yet above a 50% probabilty but I am hopeful that this is doable .

The motion will be served on the primary contact for each ISO scheduling coordinator. Parties will have an opportunity to respond. Market Participants with concerns about discovery matters in the PG&E bankruptcy proceeding should make sure they get papers from the Scheduling Coordinator primary contact in a timely manner and be prepared to present their own positions to the bankruptcy court. Market Participants should not rely on the ISO to make their arguments for them. In accordance with the tariff, the ISO will continue to provide notice of any subpoenas it receives that request information covered under section 20.3. However, once this notice has been given, Market Participants have the obligation to take the steps they deem appropriate to seek protective orders or other relief from the bankruptcy court and should not rely on the ISO to argue their positions for them or to provide ongoing notices of every development related to a subpoena after the initial notice of its reciept is given.

        "clean_content": " Sanders, Richard B (Non-Privileged).pst Stacy, This will confirm our telephone conference with Mike Farrell, Franklin Adkins' attorney, today. Based on my recommendation, you and I followed up with him today to see if Adkins still wanted to pursue his claim, despite our response to him. Farrell told us that although his client had not yet received his written legal analysis, Adkins does not want to drop the claim. Farrell told you and me that he thought the \"mere sending of your confirm\" did not overweigh the months that ENA paid Adkins under the index price, which established in Farrell's view a course of dealing between the parties that made the index price the correct price. During this short telephone conference, Farrell never said whether his client had received the confirmation. Of course, our position is that whether Adkins' telefax machine printed out the confirmation is irrelevant; we have the evidence necessary to show that we sent it. Farrell told us that he expected to send us a response next week, continuing his demand for arbitration. He did not say whether there would be any settlement offer in the letter. I will advise you as soon as I receive Farrell's letter. I would be very pleased to arbitrate this for you as your trial counsel. I believe that Farrell is correct in stating that there are sufficient facts to create a course of performance issue, on which arbitrators could rule in favor of Adkins. However, I believe that we have a persuasive argument that ENA paid the incorrect price only as a result of a clerical error. In order to support this argument, we also need to develop the following: 1. Did Franklin Adkins do or not do anything as the result of receipt of payment of the index price for a period of time that disadvantaged him? The timing of when Adkins first realized he was being paid the index price may be critical. I need to speak to the right person about how we would have made payment and what business documents were sent to Adkins after the confirm was telefaxed, and get copies of all those documents. Could someone tell me who that would be? 2. Did ENA correct the price before or after the spot market price rose above the contract price? (You had kindly agreed to do the homework on this). Also, I need Mary to advise me when she was instructed to perform the internal audit, why and by whom, and get copies from her of all her file material on that audit. I greatly appreciate your and everyone else's help. If anyone has any thoughts on other homework we could or need to be doing, please let me know. If anyone knows of someone else who needs to be in the loop on this, please let me know. I will continue to keep you advised. Britt ",

You may notice some changes in the way information is reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below. What's Different? ? Your =01+home' cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay advice. This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial modules of SAP. ? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P' represent earning types reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time for the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice as =01+PVacation'. ? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions will remain itemized in the deduction section. ? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-date totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your pay advice throughout the year. (Note that your W2 at the end of the year will reflect your earnings by company). ? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the related dollar amount will be included in the =01+Salary' earnings type. ? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555 Payroll FAQ's My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stand for? There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck. For some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to print. In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions and prints them on one line =01) titled =01&other deductions=018. The detail of all deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet at eHRonline.enron.com. What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean? These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll from the side index. Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck? Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected in the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice as =01+POvertime'. What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)? For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit is applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amount withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FICA will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return. What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock options? There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form requesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , select Enron Payroll from the side index).",

        "clean_content": "TW In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas under the tariff ought to be interpreted. Here is my list. Please add items if I've missed any. 1. When can TW \"selectively market\" available capacity? I.e., if capacity is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal? I think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to talk to one customer is always \"selective\" since there's only one guy on the phone, not all our customers. Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off the list of \"the usual suspects\" we call to pitch a special deal like an index to index deal or a discount? I've asked Lee to pull together a quick analysis of this issue. 2. If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open season context, how do we allocate it? This is the situation we got into a couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space. Are we always required to use a lottery? Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance? 3. What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate contracts? The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore). I think all neg. rate deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max rate strd language deals. 4. ??? I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.

        "clean_content": "Brazos There are some factual assertions in Brazos' memo that caught my eye. I wondered what information we have on these points: 1) at the bottom of p. 2 is a reference to a March 10, 1994 memo in which someone claimed Tenaska planned to develop this site irrespective of Brazos. The suggestion is that Tenaska would have an adequate remedy by selling power elsewhere. What is our reaction to that? 2) at the bottom of p. 5 is an assertion that we must be predicting that the difference between market and contract prices will increase over time. Is that our position? If we apply a contract v. market measure, I know we seek to base the contract portion on the escalated contract prices, but what do we use for market? (Their piece of course does not address what is the market.) 3) in the middle of p. 6 is the claim that representations were made to Brazos that Tenaska would earn a modest profit under the PPA. Do we know what that refers to? 4) at the bottom of p. 6 is a statement that under present market conditions Brazos cannot even exercise this buyout option (presumably because its payments under the PPA do not cause Brazos to be non-competitive). That is interesting. If so, what is Brazos's complaint? 5) at the bottom of p. 7 is a claim that the option period was designed as an alternative to Brazos's owning the plant at the end of the primary term. What do we know about that? What would be the effect of the pricing in the renewal term? ++++++CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE+++++ The information in this email may be confidential and/or privileged.

        "clean_content": "Action Requested: New iBuyit Order Procedures This Information Applies ONLY to Organizations Supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable Processing Centers Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement and payment tool, iBuyit eProcurement, is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central. But there is still more to come! On May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers. The new iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of receipt and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issue resolution. In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the way you currently order and pay for goods and services. Following these changes will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit Payables system. Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when placing an order and instruct them to reference this information: * Company Number or Legal Entity Name * Contact Name * Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order Number * New P.O. Box (See Below) What is an EID? An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back to the purchaser electronically through iBuyit. Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders? Yes. When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID. It is your responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for non-purchase orders. Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders? No. When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do. What if I do not know my EID? All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number. You can access your EID number in eHRonline. Logon to eHRonline, choose =01&Personal Information=018 to pull up your personal profile. On the leftside of the =01&Personal Information=018 screen select =01&Other=018 and you will see your: * PID (SAP ID) * GIS ID * EID What is our new mailing address (PO Box)? Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the following address: PO Box 4734 Houston, TX 77210-4734 What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me? HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope =01&Attention Enron Accounts Payable,=018 and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enronmail center. FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable department in Houston. Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following physical address: 3724 Dacoma Houston, TX 77092 ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE Note: ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order invoices locally. How will vendors learn about these changes? This information will be shared directly with vendors in a separate communication. Questions? Send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>",

        "clean_content": " kmann.nsf Dave / Chris: I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings recognition issue. The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to the assignment and sale of the member interests. The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC (we have had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson. Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized in Q2 vs. Q3. Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or if you have any other questions. Regards, Ben",

The counterparty is listed below: PSEG Americas Development Company, L.L.C. 35 Waterview Blvd. Parsippany, NJ 94105 The key points of the proposed transaction are: 1. The transaction would be an outright purchase of 100% of the member interests in one or both of the following project entities: Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C. Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C. 2. The purchase price of 100% of the member interests would be: Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.: $3,000,000.00 Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.: $6,000,000.00 Lisa Mellancamp was the ENA attorney who handled the CA between ENA and PSEG before Christmas. At the end of November, Lisa engaged Corey Brown at Bracewell & Patterson to handle the preparation of a draft Securities Purchase Agreement in conjunction with our discussions with Coastal Power. Corey prepared a draft SPA based upon an option to purchase structure, but Coastal Power backed away from the transaction in early December. I have received a letter from PSEG Power LLC indicating their interest in proceeding with a transaction in the near future. I will forward you a copy of this letter for your records. They have verbally indicated that the Purchase Price(s) of $3 MM and $6 MM respectively, are acceptable to them. I believe that this is the appropriate time to bring you into the process and transfer things from Lisa to yourself. Please call me to discuss the SPA once you have reviewed the appropriate documents. I will be in Chicago tomorrow. I can be reached by cell at (713) 412-4612 or leave me a voicemail.

        "clean_content": " skean.nsf John & Hengerer's summary of today's Commission meeting. February 23, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: Interested Clients FROM: John & Hengerer RE: Commission Meeting -- February 23, 2000 At today's meeting, the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and discussed the following items. HYDRO AGENDA Public Utility District No. 1 of Okanogan County, Washington, Docket No. P-10536 This draft order rescinded the hydro license issued to Public Utility District No. 1 of Okanogan County, Washington (Utility District) after the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) conditioned the license on construction of a fish ladder that would have rendered the proposed project uneconomic. Commissioner Hebert moved the item to the discussion agenda to highlight the difficulties incurred in hydro licensing proceedings due to the conditioning authority granted to certain federal agencies, such as NMFS. Because such agencies possess the authority to impose costly environmental conditions, Commission Hebert stated, they essentially hold veto power over project applications. Commissioner Hebert urged federal agencies to weigh potential public benefits before imposing costly environmental conditions that doom proposed projects. Avista Corporation, Docket No. P-2058 In this draft order, the Commission granted a hydro license to Avista Corporation. Chairman Hoecker moved the item to the discussion agenda to champion the use of alternate licensing procedures and applaud the parties for negotiating the settlement approved by the draft order. Avista began negotiating for the license in 1996 and eventually reached a settlement with 26 stakeholders. According to Chairman Hebert, such negotiations maximize benefits, reduce application costs, and set a positive example for other parties to follow. Although the other Commissioners generally echoed Chairman Hoecker's praise, Commissioner Hebert criticized the draft order for not quantifying the environmental benefits of Avista's proposed project. ELECTRIC MATTERS New England Power Pool, ISO New England, Docket Nos. ER00-984, et al. Price caps on the ISO's Operating Reserve and Operable Capability markets were extended by the Commission in this draft order, Commissioner Hebert dissenting. Both caps expired on December 31, 1999. The cap on the Operating Reserve Market was extended until June 30, 2000, or until the ISO submits a market redesign plan to correct market flaws. The cap on the Operable Capability Market was extended until February 29, 2000, after which the market will be terminated. According to the ISO's filing, which was approved in this draft order, the Operable Capability Market duplicates other ISO markets and is no longer needed. Commissioner Hebert dissented and moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his disapproval of price caps, both in general and in this particular proceeding. In general, Commissioner Hebert believes that price caps remove the natural incentives created by a competitive market. In this particular proceeding, Commission Hebert argues that supposedly temporary price caps have become a Acrutch@ relied on by the ISO. Moreover, Commissioner Hebert does not believe that the ISO market is flawed and contends that the ISO has failed to illustrate the existence of any flaws. For these reasons, Commissioner Hebert would not have extended the price caps. Regional Transmission Organizations (Order on Rehearing), Docket No. RM99-2 In this draft rehearing order, while making relatively minor clarifications and revisions, the Commission unanimously affirmed the policy decisions outlined in Order No. 2000.89 FERC & 61,285 (1999) Issued in December 1999, Order No. 2000 outlined the Commission's policy with regard to RTO formation and adopted regulations governing the filing and review of RTO proposals. This draft order affirmed the voluntary and flexible approach adopted by Order No. 2000, as well as the RTO functions and characteristics outlined in that order. However, the draft order does include a number of relatively minor revisions and clarifications. Specifically, the draft order: (i) denies requests to phase out passive ownership of RTO facilities by transmission owners, but clarifies that passive owners must not interfere with day-to-day RTO operations; (ii) clarifies Section 205 tariff filing rights by reiterating that RTOs should have control of their own tariffs, while transmission owners should determine their own return on equity; (iii) incorporates Order No. 2000's audit requirements into Commission regulations, while ruling that the both an RTOs ownership and governance structures are subject to audit; and (iv) clarifies that public utility compliance filings must specify what efforts were made to include RTO participation by public cooperatives. In approving the draft rehearing order only two months after the issuance of Order No. 2000, the Commission hopes that the ongoing collaborative process will be able to focus on the basic elements of RTO formation, rather than on the contentious issues raised in the rehearing requests. Order No. 2000's collaborative process began this month and is scheduled to run through April 2000. Public Utilities not currently participating in a regional transmission entity are required to make a compliance filing by October 15, 2000, while those utilities that are already a part of a regional entity must make a compliance filing by January 15, 2001. Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, et al., Docket Nos. ER00-448, et al. In this draft order, the Commission unanimously (Commissioner Massey concurring) voiced its support for the binary RTO model proposed in this proceeding, but declined to issue the requested declaratory order until a final proposal is filed. The binary model proposed by Midwest ISO participants would require the ISO to delegate certain functions to a for-profit transco, while retaining other functions and maintaining responsibility for overseeing the transcos activities. The draft order commends parties for developing the proposal and finds that the proposed binary model generally conforms to the Commission's RTO mandate. However, the Commission declined to make a final determination until a complete proposal is submitted. Commissioner Massey's concurrence raises concerns associated with the sharing of power between an ISO and a transco. Commissioner Massey believes that such a division of power may be counterproductive and urges the parties to address the issue in their final filing. PIPELINE MATTERS ANR Pipeline Company, Docket No. CP99-241 ANR's proposal to increase mainline capacity from Joliet, Illinois, into Wisconsin was approved in this draft order. Specifically, the draft order permits ANR to construct an additional 20,000 horsepower of mainline capacity, thereby increasing mainline capacity into Wisconsin by 109,000 Dth/day by November 1, 2000. The Commission approved ANR's proposal after concluding that demand in Wisconsin justifies the expansion. The expansion approved in this draft order is part of ANR's SupplyLink proposal (to be built in conjunction with the Independence/MarketLink project). ANR decided to proceed with the Joliet-to-Wisconsin expansion after the SupplyLink/Independence/MarketLink project was delayed due to Commission concerns that the project was not adequately supported by market demand. Although the expansion approved in this draft order was unrelated to the contentious portions of the larger project, Commissioner Hebert nonetheless moved the item to the discussion agenda to express his belief that market demand justifies the Independence/MarketLink project. Specifically, Commissioner Hebert cited recent spikes in heating oil prices as evidence that gas demand in the northeastern United States more than justifies the project. Commissioner Breathitt disagreed with Commission Hebert and argued that the price of heating oil does not necessarily correlate to natural gas demand. ",

Their next Board meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that meeting. We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until their Board votes on the full agreement. The other option is to get done this week and have them call a special Board meeting. They have done this in the past, but we have not asked them if it's logistically possible to do this by May 31. Thanks -- David ",

They gave us the flexibility we needed for the financing, but I don't know that they are something Enron Corp. wants to live with in our template document. Rose 22.2 Assignment by Purchaser or Agent. Neither Party shall assign any or all of their duties or rights under this Contract without prior written consent from the other Party; such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If the Purchaser wishes to obtain the Seller's consent to the assignment of Purchaser's duties or rights under this Contract, it shall request such consent in a writing which includes or incorporates: (a) the legal name and address and the form and place of incorporation or organization of the proposed assignee; (b) the current published annual report of the proposed assignee, or if no such report is published three years of audited financial statements and a description of the proposed assignee's business; and (c) a descriptive list of power generation projects completed by the assignee during the preceding year. Seller shall respond to any request for consent within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such request. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (w) any lender participating in or providing financing or financing structures, including, without limitation, structures related to leasing arrangements and project financing in respect of any Unit, may transfer or assign its rights associated with such Unit upon liquidation or foreclosure of such Unit in satisfaction of Purchaser's obligations under such financing structure; (x) either Party may without further consent by the other Party delegate or assign its duties or rights to any Affiliate or subsidiary; (y) Purchaser may without further consent of the Seller delegate or assign its duties or rights to any Affiliate of Enron Corp.; or (z) if Purchaser holds or controls other material assets associated with the Facility into which any Unit will be installed (the =01&Transferred Facility=018) and if Purchaser transfers of all or substantially all of its rights in and to such assets, Purchaser may without further consent delegate or assign its duties or rights associated with such Unit to the transferee of such other assets (the =01&Transferee=018), provided that one of the following conditions has and continues to be fulfilled: (i) prior to payment of the Purchase Amount, that Transferee (A) has provided financial guarantees reasonably satisfactory to the Seller and valid until such time as the Purchase Amount shall be paid in full, or (B) has demonstrated that it has credit rated by Standard & Poor's at BBB- or better, and has agreed that if it fails to maintain such rating until the Purchase Amount shall have been paid in full that it will provide financial guarantees as described in subsection (A) above. (ii) that Transferee shall provide representations reasonably satisfactory to Seller that a credit facility covering the Transferred Facility has been agreed and is operative. Purchaser or Agent shall have the right to assign or pledge, from time to time, all or any portion of their respective right, title and interest in, to and under the Agreement as collateral for financing of this Facility without Seller's consent. When duly assigned in accordance with this Section (including, following any collateral assignment, upon foreclosure by any collateral assignee), (i) this Agreement or the rights and/or obligations so assigned shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the assignee (and all rights and/or obligations so assigned, including, without limitation, any and all warranty rights, shall be assigned to the assignee as if such assignee were an original party hereto), (ii) the assignor shall be irrevocably relieved of and forever discharged from all liability under this Agreement so long as the assignee executes an assumption of such liabilities, and (iii) the Seller shall look only to such assignee for the performance of the obligations so assigned. Any assignment by Purchaser other than as permitted herein shall be void and without force or effect. The parties hereto further agree and acknowledge that the foregoing provisions relating to this assignment will only control the assignment of Purchaser's rights under this Agreement prior to the date upon which the Equipment achieves Takeover. Following such date, Purchaser shall be permitted, without Seller's consent, to: (i) assign its rights under this Agreement, (ii) convey any ownership interest that it may have in the Facility and/or (iii) convey any equity interest that it may have in the entity which owns the Facility.

The bill is being opposed by AOL, Microsoft, Charles Schwab, CMTA, Chamber, GTE/Verizon, AEA, Retailers, Financial Services Association and the Internet Alliance. All of those parties are scheduled to meet with Assembly Member Wayne at different times on Wednesday to try and get him to drop the bill which is being sponsored by the Attorney General. In the event that fails, the group is also trying to get the bill double-referred to the Senate Banking Committee where they have a much better chance of stopping it versus the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill will be heard by the Judiciary Committee on August 21. With respect to Enron's participation in any opposition effort, there was some concern that the Judiciary Committee may not be the best place because Peace is on that committee and would likely do anything to get at Enron (support?).

Although the original request was to delete the proposed changes to Section 3(a) entirely leaving only the original wire transfer amounts, we need to consistently reflect appropriate funds movements as of March 30, 2000. The change is intended to accommodate both Henry's request and complete reflection of funds movement. Regards, NJD ",

        "clean_content": "Security and Human Rights Policy Question We are finishing the legal comments to the Security and Human Rights paper that Lauren Goldblatt circulated for legal review, and will finalize it today ot tomorrow. Before get the detailed comments out, however, there is a threshold policy issue that needs to be considered: These guidelines expressly applicaty to the \"Extractive Industries\", which are typically thought of as the mining and oil and gas exploration and development industries. The companies listed as cooperating with the UK and US governments and the NGO's in producing the principles do not include Enron peers. Enron has only one unit that is engaged in that economic sector, and that unit is being sold right now. None of Enron's other units are in what would normally be referred to as an extractive industry. Since that is the case, we wonder if Enron has made an appropriate level policy decision to publicly endorse these principles and make them corporate policy when the company is energetically exiting its only remaining business line that is in the express industrial peer group targeted by the principles? At first I understood that such a decision had been taken, but Vicki and I wanted to confirm that before proceeding. There are two major concerns: Endorsing the principles would would identify Enron more closely with the members of a particular peer group that Enron is consciously exiting and distingushing itself from. Once Enron endorses the principles, the fact of that endorsement, the resulting public \"accountability\" for the principles, and the consequent need to demonstrate compliance will become essentially a permanent feature. Once endorsed, it would be nearly impossible for the Company to distance itself from the guidlines. That being the case, should Enron at this juncture endorse the guidelines when it could do so later if it ever makes a committed re-entry into the extractive industry? Are there other security type principles that are more appropriate to or focused on our new core business lines, or the remaining asset ownership and construction lines that Enron should be looking at instead? Please call either me at 713-646-6309 to discuss. You can also call Vicki Sharp at 713-853-7413. Thanks. ",

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

You will note there are seven Action Items from the last meeting. Under Item 2, Overview of Regulatory and Legislative Agenda, it was agreed that the status of the issues that had been previously referred by the Committee to various subcommittees would be discussed at the next meeting. The subcommittee chairs have been reminded of this assignment. Also under Item 2, several members agreed to create an outline of the legislative and regulatory issues that involve ERISA and affect CTA's. A draft has been produced. Item 6, Uptick Rule, Member Silber volunteered to review the SEC proposal when it is issued and draft a comment letter.

        "clean_content": " jarnold.nsf Bob, I want to make sure I keep you in the loop on the EBS/BMC/NetWorks/Global Strategic Sourcing interactions. EBS has worked out an additional 25% discount, which brings the total discount structure to Enron to a 45%-off pricing level, if EBS and Enron aggregate their spend opportunity. This should come as good news to anyone at Net Works who might be about to implement a BMC solution. Also, there is additional flexibility in the situation, in that BMC will be willing to work with Enron business units with regard to the timing of their software purchases as it relates to applicability in EBS' deal. For example, if Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their current testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail (or other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 (the preference would be to get the \"buy\" done by end of 1st Qtr, if possible). This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with their purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC. I'm going to contact your leads (Randy, Bruce, et. al.) to let them know of the additional possible discount and the relative ease of securing it...and to also help make sure that what BMC is pricing out to all is the correct application solution in each instance.

Some romantic guys were kind of going in that direction. My position was to take the subject to a Market Assembly for the shareholders to deliberate. Also everybody knows, and some acknowledged, that MAE governance was not working. Our line of action at the Assembly would be to support the general direction of the measures, and at the same time, preserve MAE autonomy, opening a negotiable line with ANEEL. The main point of discussion will be if we should discuss without going to court or after challenging ANEEL in court. The Assembly was called for next Thursday, April 26th. Fred is going to talk to Luiz Maurer for us to have a deep exam of the resolutions and see what points we can propose to ANEEL to improve. Also, in that negotiable line, we should discuss/propose some names to the new COEX. We need to discuss this subject tomorrow. Jo?o Carlos ",

        "clean_content": "Call w/ John Schroeder of GE I talked with John a few minutes ago. Here's the gist of the conversation: 1. Miller was promised the 4 7FAs based on his discussions with John concerning Enron's interest. GE is wavering a bit on this now, however, because other sales reps within GE have complained that we were given first crack. John characterized our current position as \"the front of the line without a pass\". 2. Ultimately (and obviously), Dell Williamson will decide to whom these turbines are allocated. 3. John said we should have a proposed letter agreement on the turbines this afternoon. He emphasized that they do not yet have the requisite GE internal approvals. Nonetheless, the major terms included in the Letter Agreement would be as follows: - Form of turbine purchase contract would be the GenPower 7FA turbine purchase agreement, modified to include standard Enron provisions negotiated between Sheila Tweed et. al. concerning assignment, indemnities, etc.; - the turbine purchase contract would need to be executed by the end of January; - 5% of the purchase amount would need to be paid upon execution of the Letter Agreement, with an additional 5% due at the end of the month. The balance of payments in the turbine purchase agreement would be paid in equal monthly instalments for each turbine through the respective turbine's delivery date (last day of each of March, April, May, and June); - we would be required to negotiate with GE in good faith on an LTSA, water system and STG (if needed). This would not be an exclusive, nor would we be subject to payment adders to the extent our good faith negotiations do not result in a definitive agreement. - the Letter Agreement will not be drafted as an option (even though it will essentially operate as one), but instead will be a letter agreement for the purchase of turbines. Unfortunately, the semantics of this are both important to us and GE, but I believe it will be extremely difficult to do anything other than the form and semantics that GE wants (as we are competing with other buyers who do not have the same balance sheet constraints as us). As such, we may want to consider an interim OBS vehicle such as LJM if the looseness of the contract presents challenges for the TurboPark banks. Lastly, given the somewhat tenuous nature of our queue position on the turbines, John strongly suggested that Delainey be immediately briefed, and that he call Dell as soon as possible based on the information John provided me in our conversation described above. He also suggested that we indicate to Dell that we have firm sites (Florida and Longview) for the units. John told me that this latter point is important to GE as they are becoming fatigued by their other customers who have slues of turbines and not enough sites to accommodate them. Let me know if you have any other questions. FYI, I put in a call to Lisa Bills on this deal, but have still not heard back from her. Regards, Ben",

Cc:Ceklund@llgm.com Subject:PX Committee call In today's call we addressed the usual issues. This Friday the complex litigation panel will decide whether to consolidate the commandeering suits. In case you hadn't noticed, the state filed a declaratory relief action in Sacramento naming each of the individual participants but not the PX. The state's alleged fear is that it might be exposed to double recovery to the PX and the individual participants, so it asks for a declaration of its exposure to the participants. The new complaint has not yet been served. Ourcounsel who are trying to keep matters simple are considering strategies that will avoid the need for each participant to respond, and we should havesome recommendation next week. Next, Howard Weg will circulate a draft motion to FERC submitting his proposed settlement. We should have the draft within the next week. Next, a subcommittee met with PG&E reps last week toget a preview of a possible reorganization plan. Weg may call Michael Tribolet to get his take on plan structure. Next, the state Senate evidently balked at the Edison bailout. Reliant and Marant have not filed a petitionand are considering their options in view of the possibility that the governor will call the legislature back into special session in early October. In the meantime, Edison is producing documents in response to the 2004 notice. Weg raised a question about whether Enron will be filing an administrative claim in the PG&E case pursuant to court order in that case. I wasn't aware of the issue. Are you? There were productive plan discussions with PX representatives as to structure and tasks of the PX going forward, andwe are expecting a proposal momentarily. Discussions with the Trade Creditors Committee still haven't reached closure. PX reps evidently will be approaching PG&E and Edison to share the cost of future operations. Our nextcommittee call is Sept. 26 at 2. We still need to talk about the funding issue when you have a moment.

Each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting Bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow up with HR on schedules being used at Enron The following is what I heard at the first meeting: Our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that would more or less guarantee (other than maybe an occasional call) you have the weekend off. Cross-training seemed to be the key here. Some desks seemed to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels. Cross-training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a \"just do it\" attitude. There doesn't have to be an across the board solution for Logistics. However all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk changes. Late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders willingness to do deals at any time. As we get a better handle on what other companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address this. Everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid-week etc. and really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job. There were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some type of rotating group. Mixed feelings about whether the group would be open to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule. Feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification. I'm looking forward to our next meeting - Bob ",

It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed. 3. There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign. 4. Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp. 5.

As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22. We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month. We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave. We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed. We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed. The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns. The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan. Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy. These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate. The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process. To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee. We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible. This is currently our top priority, bar none! When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be. Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place. We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation. The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved. That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse. We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan. We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court. We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court. With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future. In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week. And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible. ",

DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the transaction process for licensees: Document Sharing: deal-related materials in various formats (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures, etc.) can be uploaded for deal participants to view and/or edit. Auctioning/Bidding: licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender bids. Multi-media: customers can present high quality virtual road shows and asset descriptions using streaming video. Secure Communication: DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many communication. Deal Management: DealNotesTM enables customers to monitor the progress of their deals using statistics on user downloads, bidding/auction results and user page views. Applications DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for the new headquarters building. Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide for the hosting of online datarooms.

The PUCT approved this as a docketed case and as such we will need to file a Motion to intervene on or before May 21, 2001. I am preparing to file the motion on behalf of EPMI. There will be a pre-hearing conference on May 22, 2001 that will set the testimony and hearing schedule. The auction must be completed by September 1, 2001. This will be the last opportunity to comment before the PUCT prior to the first capacity auction. As you review Schedule CA, please be aware that some of the provisions have two different proposals. We may provide comments on the merits of one alternative or another or provide an alternative position that may not be included in the document. The capacity auction rule itself will not be subject to comments at this time. I will prepare an issues list and circulate it after the Pre-hearing conference (May 23, 2001).

        "clean_content": " skean.nsf This past Tuesday, Ron Tapscott, Dwight Larson, Saeed Raja and myself met w/ all 5 counterparties from Cristobal (AEP, First Energy, CMS Energy, Detroit Edison and Virginia Power - collectively the Alliance Partners) to initiate the discussions and process of asset valuations. Also, attending the meeting on behalf of the Alliance Partners was a representative from Arthur Andersen who will be assisting them in this process. AA has also been working with the Partners since their own inception of forming an RTO. Overall the meeting was productive and we focused on both asset valuations as well as structural issues. We itemized a general list of data/info (deliverables) that will be necessary to begin the analysis/negotiation process. We also highlighted a list of specific issues related to structural aspects which we (ENE) felt were critical path items and have to be addressed. The Alliance Partners focus is that the combination of operating synergies, revenue enhancements, growth and financial engineering for a Pipe/Wire combo has to produce significant upside value that the Wires Co can't get on its own. Of the 5 Alliance Partners, it is clear that 3 of them (AEP, First Energy and Detroit Edison) are definitely \"in the game\" and serious about moving forward. We're not so sure about either CMS or Va Power. The primary obstacle seems to be both parties apparent reluctance to divulge the level of financial/operating information (which they feel is too sensitive of info to be shared on an individual basis at this time) necessary to move the deal forward. They did however agree to AA playing the role of an information clearinghouse whereby each Alliance Partner can send its individual data to AA who in turn will aggregate it into one \"Wires Co.\" Finally, both CMS and VP seem to be somewhat \"non-committal\" towards how they would participate (i.e., divest, lease, etc...) but AEP, First Energy and Detroit Edison all made it very clear that once the group (at least a majority thereof) decides to move forward, any entity not divesting would be excluded from subsequent discussions, etc... where values, structural issues, etc... are being discussed. They would essentially be treated as a counterparty in an ordinary contracting process. The path forward with action items and deadlines are as follows: 1/7 - ENE is to provide AA with basic GPG financial info pursuant to the list we discussed in the meeting (basically, FERC Form 2 data) 1/7 - ENE is also to provide to AA for each of the 5 Alliance Partners, the financial info, assumptions, etc... we have used to date in our analysis 1/7 - CMS to decide if they're interested in including their pipes (PEPL and TGP) 1/10 - AA is to distribute ENE's assumptions/info to each respective Alliance Partner for them to review/confirm/edit (as needed) 1/17 - AA is to have gathered the individual data from each Partner and \"aggregate\" it into one Wires Co and submit it to all parties including ENE 1/28 - AA is to analyze and quantify the potential operating synergies for Wires Co and submit a new \"synergized\" version of Wires Co financial data/info 2/4 - next meeting with ENE and Alliance Partners scheduled in Houston at ENE office (Beth Ryan coordinating details) ENE to outline/summarize details re: all structural issues and send to Alliance Partners prior to the 2/4 meeting in Houston If you have any questions/comments, call me at x33212 to discuss.

These issues have been addressed in earlier E-Mails and this is an updated list of issues that need to be completed by June 19, 2000. 1) King Ranch interstates - Fred and Stella are working with Exxon to reconcile from Oct 1999 - Apr 2000 the interstate nominations for Tennessee and NGPL and also for Tejas. 2) Tetco Meter 6892 - Question of who has custody transfer at the meter. ENA is using Tetco's volume and HPLC is using the HPL Measurement volume, causing a desk to desk variance. Clem and Pat are working on. 3) Transco Bammel Meter 74 - Transco and HPL's nominations are out of balance at Meter 74. Charlotte needs to work with Transco to resolve. 4) Dow Meter 4486 - The sale to Entex needs to be taken off of HPLC meter 4486 and the sale needs to be at Dow Meter 4486. A desk to desk between ENA (buyer) and HPLC (seller) needs to be set up on Dow Meter 4486. Ami needs to set up the deals and Thu needs to coordinate the months involved. Once this is done and Thu reallocates to Dow Pipeline, Jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and make the meter non allocatable in Pops. Clem verified with Steve Schneider that this meter is not on HPL's system. 5) East Texas Gas / Devon - Devon invoicing ENA entire flow at Carthage. Meter 4607701 East Texas keeping HPLC whole on nominations Desk to desk deal is out of balance because of this Karen is working with Pennzoil and East Texas to reach agreement on how to handle this issue between them 6) PGEV - Actuals on swing meters (HPL ) not matching expense volumes being allocated by PGEV. Sherlyn is working with Stacey and Charlotte to resolve. 7) Pan Energy Sales issues - discrepancies on PGEV. Katherine and Sherlyn are working with Stacey to resolve. ",

        "clean_content": "Enron Demo Recap Here's a recap of our demo meeting with Enron's Global Strategic Sourcing group on Tuesday... Demo went well. In attendance for Perfect were Ian, James M and David Y. Enron's attendees were: - John Gillespie - Sr Director GSS - Platforms & Processes (decision maker) - Pam Tragesser - GSS Operations Mgr (asst to Derryl C - Sr Dir GSS - Operations) - John Will - Director Sourcing - Pipe Valves & Fittings - Craig Brown - Director Sourcing - Chemicals, Oils & Lubricants - Shirley Jo Dickens-Wilson - Enron Transportation Services Procurement Mgr - Eugene Ribaudo - Enron Energy Services Procurement Mgr - ibuyit.com team lead - Ken Sommers - Enron Energy Services Procurement Mgr Despite only having 1 hour to present, Ian competently ran through a company and feature overview, then blasted through a demo of PS2 and PPD. We did not get to show PI. They all bought in that this was a sophisticated sourcing tool, that it followed their processes and would help streamline their operation. Only negatives we heard was that the $1M price tag was a show stopper, and that they were trying to minimize RFQs and focus on release against agreements. With 2000 revs at over $100B, and a spend to match that, their ROI would be tremendous. Shirley Jo said that her primary use of this system would be for any purchase over $50k, which requires 3 bids. She does not feel that she has enough of these events to justify implementation in her ETS group. Their current processes are basically pen, paper, phone and fax. They do use RFQ templates and Excel spreadsheets. They also model Total Cost of Ownership - evaluating the total lifecycle of materials. They are using their homegrown auction platform, DealBench, and were trying to compare this against our system. Their transaction fees for using the DealBench system are minor, so our pricing looks high, but that would be comparing apples against oranges. I will address this in the cover letter on the pilot proposal we will send. Questions that came up included: - What is the difference between maverick spend in Procurement vs Sourcing? Ian responded Perfect reduces maverick spend during the sourcing cycle by standardizing company best practices and providing visibility/accountability of vendor selection criteria. - How does the optimization calculation work? Ian gave basic explanation of input variables and ranking/scoring. Don't feel we need to elaborate on this at this point, possibly in future. - Can we utilize a hands-on demo to play with the system? We suggested a pilot, but also said that it might be possible to work something out over Webex just to test drive a little more before moving into a pilot. We agreed that the next step is for us to send a pilot proposal and they will get together either Friday or sometime next week to review the proposal, discuss their opinions and determine the next step. ----------------------- I sent the Pilot Proposal and cover letter out today by email after final approval by Ian. I will followup on Monday to find out what their evaluation gameplan is and to suggest meetings so that we can get ROI inputs to allow James to workup an ROI proposal. David M.

I have not heard from him yet, either. I will let you know if anything progresses on the deal side. Will you let me know what progresses on the ISDA and legal side. Also, if I am around, will you let me know when the conference call with the lawyers is. I would like to sit in on the call. Hopefully, I will speak with John today and hear more about it. Since I inherited this account from someone who recently left Enron, I don't know John as well as I would if he had been my client all along. Of course, I am not complaining - always happy to inherit a client ready to do a deal. Thanks again for your help. Lisa ",

Natsource does not intend to execute before Monday the 26th. As a follow up to a meeting held on March 8th with representatives from your organizations, I wanted to outline the procedures which were discussed for Broker confirmations. Strict adherence to these procedures will ensure that we mitigate Enron's exposure to broken broker executions. Broker executes a transaction on www.brokerclient.com Broker receives instataneous electronic confirmation on broker client Broker obligation per contract: On the day of each Execution, Broker will (i) verify each Execution with the relevant Counterparty in writing or by telephone, (ii) notify Enron of such verification by telephone and (iii) deliver to Enron a written summary of all Executions which occurred on such day and confirming the verifications thereof. Broker agrees that it will record all telephone conversations with Counterparties regarding Transactions and will make copies of such recordings available to Enron on reasonable request. Enron will confirm all broker executed transactions by close of business each day in writing, by telephone or electronically Any issues raised during the broker confirmation will be immediately brought to the attention of Tom Moran (Houston credit; Debbie Brackett backup), Paul Maley (London Credit; Tim Davies backup). If you cannot reach any of the credit contacts, call The EnronOnline Help desk at 713 853-HELP and report the broker confirmation issue. Credit and or Product Control will zero out the broker credit until the issue has been resolved. Credit and or Product Control will notify the Bob Shults (Dan Diamond backup) of any issues After a broker has been fully checked out each day, the confirmations group will email the credit contacts listed above with positive confirmation notice indicating that there are no issues for that broker for that day. This will allow credit to identify potential problems due to someone not calling on issues. Transactions executed on EnronOnline by a broker will not have any reference to EnronOnline and will be documented as it they were voice brokered transactions. The transactions will never be contracted under an EnronOnline General Terms & Conditions. Confirmations with the counterparty will be handle the same as a voice brokered transaction.",

(iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include \"Baa3 by Moody's\" and \"failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's\". (iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of \"Qualified Institution\" to include not only the rating we assign, but also \"having assets in excess of $10 billion\" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party (v) FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made on a Valuation Date. I think we should retain language that demands can be made on or after a Valuation Date. But I think we could agree that demands be made prior to 5 pm New York time. 5.

        "clean_content": " vkamins.nsf To: Enron North America Corp. From: Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets, and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce the following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA. 1) Coverage/Origination: To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service companies and IPP's; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries. Downstream Coverage/Origination As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear that the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp. Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp. Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENA's existing energy commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also EES's energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel's chemicals, plastics and refined products risk management capability. These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg's leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering: a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision of paper risk management products; b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries; c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers Trust's global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to leadthe coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing industries. Midstream Coverage/Origination a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group' activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect. We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of this group; b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. They will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring opportunities in the Western U.S. We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination efforts; c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio's of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group. In addition, Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect; d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructuring opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets. We have asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair, formerly of Enron Asia's development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join this newly formed business. 2) Commercial Transactions: The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA's efficiency in executing transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage. CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management. The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership, execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups. This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions: a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western Coverage/Origination Groups. The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy Lemmons joined Enron in 1992. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA's industrial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining, Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established. The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich. We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups. The senior members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud and John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix. We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups. The senior members of this team include Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert. We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend. Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams. Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group. The remaining four groups within CTG will remain largely unchanged. In addition, the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together. We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ENA's markets particularly in the industrial markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups. Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in North America by working with us to implement these changes.",

All information submitted after that time will be held until the following week. 2) A draft of EnTouch will be forwarded to each business unit head (or their designee) and commercial group head (or their designee), who has a Business Highlight or other information appearing in that particular issue. E-mail, phone or in-person approval will be required from either a business unit head (or their designee) or commercial group head (or their designee) prior to distribution to Enron Messaging Administration on Thursday at 2:00 pm. 3) If approval is not received prior to the deadline, the Business Highlight or other information will be pulled until approval is received. 4) In the event a business unit or commercial group provides information that crosses business unit or commercial group lines, all affected business units and commercial groups will receive the draft and a representative of each involved party will be required to approve per instruction # 2. I believe this process will alleviate the two problems that have occurred over the past few months. Please advise. Additionally, I have attached the list of contacts Kathie uses for gathering EnTouch information. It includes the primary contacts and their secondary contacts.

        "clean_content": " rshapiro.nsf Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time ASMAE employee) was expressing her [distorted] views to the press on why generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view. I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from expressing an opposite opinion. There are two problems in Patricia's view: 1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6 months. Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail. 2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments. A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally, as you see fit) 1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts. * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other agreements should not abide by their clauses? 2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement provisions? Guess what the answer was? None 3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98) * This is serious * That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not want to abide by Law? No response 4) Some companies do not have Annex V * So what? Discussion is about Annex V * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts 6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk represented by Annex V * So what? * Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have regulated prices. * Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors) 7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch * Wrong * ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool operation * Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called \"dry period relief\" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by Annel. The spot price is a \"proxy\" for the depth of rationing. One should not evoke rationing. I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is \"bullet proof\". In the meantime, let me share my views: * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make this clear at the outset. * We should make Minister Patente realize that Mario Arce's proposal is non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices is a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) . If we do want to create a market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and worse. * Generators should have the burden of proof. In the meantime, Annex V is effective and should be enforceable * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex V. * The argument \"no one should lose, no one should gain\" during rationing is inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously. Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market. * We have to be as transparent as possible. Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week. I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea. LM ",

Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces. The scope includes a review of the processes which impact the accuracy of information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process. They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications. The projected timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days. We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips. This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available: 1) the ability to track data \"accuracy\" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique \"failures\". How complete is the data? 2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?) 3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows 4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed. Please call me if you would like to discuss. Wanda Curry ",

I just spoke with Bob Ellery over at Sierra, and he confirmed that, although the company is a corporation, they never use \"Inc.\" in their contracts. Thus, our confirm letters would not match up with the master agreement because of those three pesky letters. Just let me know if this causes a problem for either of you. In case you'd like to reference it, the deal number we're attempting to modify is 573679 - it's a buy from Sierra done by Chris Foster on the 10th of April. Thanks again for all your help.

As Chair Herbert said: SPP should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously. (Issues for possible rehearing are ****). ? The Commission declined to approve SPP's scope and configuration because the SPP members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to transfer operational control and the SPP/Entergy relationship remains somewhat undefined. The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Entergy and SPP must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue. o Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the SPP RTO borders. There are significant sales and purchases between SPP and SERC (and Midwest companies to a lesser extent.) o Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer control of transmission to SPP. o MOU must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an RTO, such as operational authority, ATC calculation and planning/expansion, will be met. ? Approves Entergy's proposal for a Managing Member that controls all voting rights to the Transco and approves Entergy's Board approval process (states that Entergy would control no more than two of the selection committee's seven members). ?

        "clean_content": "Enron/Natole Turbine Schedule Richard-- We have agreed to depose Ron Natole on Feb. 18 at 10 a.m., at his lawyer's office. I will copy you on the amended notice we are sending out today. We have not rescinded our depo notices for the 2 Korean gentlemen, but have agreed to reset the dates. I expect Plaintiff's counsel will de-designate these men rather than bring them here for their depos. The only other notice we sent out last week was for the designated expert from the Wood Group -- Robert Harrison. I will attempt to obtain available dates directly from him. With respect to the depos of Enron personnel, please check with Mike Miller and Bob Virgo regarding their availability during the 2 weeks we discussed -- Feb. 21 and Feb. 28 -- March 3. Of course, we will also need a block of time in advance of the depos to prepare with the witnesses. Bill has a trial setting the 2nd week (Feb. 28), which may be postponed in the near future. If it is not, I can present them for their depos. Plaintiff's counsel has not mentioned any other Enron personnel by name, but has generally requested dates for anyone else we may be presenting at trial as a fact witness or corporate rep. The only other name that I recall having potentially significant involvement was Dave Marshall, an ECT risk management guy who appears to have had some discussions with IBC's Ron Anderson about Enron's requirements with respect to repaired/refurbished parts. Bill believes there may be other Enron witnesses, and that Miller and Virgo will know who they are. We are also working up a list of proposed mediators -- preferably with strong commercial litigation experience. Gary McGowan currently heads the list, but I would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions you may have. Lastly, I agree with your suggestion regarding our question as to why the Wood Group (Robert Harrision) has appeared on Plaintiff's expert list. It would certainly be helpful to have Miller's thoughts on that subject. --Grant Dorfman - att1.htm ",

(\"Enron\") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron. Further, Enron's Business Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege. Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise: << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you.

As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22. We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month. We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave. We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed. We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed. The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns. The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan. Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy. These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate. The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process. To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee. We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible. This is currently our top priority, bar none! When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be. Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place. We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation. The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved. That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse. We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan. We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court. We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court. With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future. In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week. And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible. ",

The various trade associations will be most responsive to the idea if they are hearing strong support for a single agreement from decision-making levels within member firms. We will separately continue or commence a dialogue with the trade associations that sponsor various agreements or are active in the areas of the financial products that would be covered by such an agreement. The trade associations we have identified as likely to be important to this project are the following: Securities Industry Association (US) The Bond Market Association (US) International Securities Market Association (principally Europe) European Banking Federation (Europe) The Foreign Exchange Committee (NY, London, Tokyo) Emerging Markets Traders Association The following associations may also be helpful to the process: Australian Financial Markets Association British Bankers Association Japan Securities Dealers Association Canadian Bankers Association International Primary Markets Association (London-based) ACI (The Foreign Exchange Association)(Paris-based)_ If your firm is active in any of these organizations, we encourage you to discuss as soon as possible with your representative within that organization the need to support the development of a single agreement for financial products and urge them to express their support to the associations. If it would be useful to share with them the thoughts in my memorandum to the board, please feel free to do so. I have attached an edited version which deletes the last couple of sections on my discussions with the BMA, the Russo-Carlin group, Ernie Patrikis's letter and possible approaches for ISDA.

According to Illinois counsel, there is no quirk in Illinois law that mitigates against being able to enforce a contract with a party who signs the contract under a registered d/b/a name. Since we have a copy of the company's d/b/a filing certified by the Illinois Secretary of State, we should already have everything we need. In an abundance of caution, we could ask the counterparty's corporate secretary to certify that \"[actual corporate name]\" and \"[d/b/a name]\" are one and the same entity. But I personally think even doing that is overkill -- the Illinois Secretary of State is already basically telling us that in the certificate we already have in the file.

I have visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing your major groups. It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K committee did. We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue. Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis. Costs would be shared proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to a specific operating group. I believe we need this inventory. If we try to enforce our non-competition agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.

(269th Judicial District Court, Harris County) PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION This morning I received a copy of the Summons, Petition and Request for Disclosure filed in the above-referenced case. I have had a copy put on your desk. The CT Service of Process Transmittal Form indicates that Enron was served on January 4. By my calculations, Enron's answer is due on January 29. The petition generally alleges that the plaintiff entered into a contract with Empressa Electrica de Guatemala, S.A involving barges in the port of Puerto Quetzal in Guatemala. Plaintiff further alleges that Enron assumed the plaintiff's position in this contract, expanded the project and failed to pay the pro rata amount allegedly due to plaintiff because of the expansion. I think you had been working on a dispute involving Texas Ohio Power's claims pertaining to the Empressa PPA, the barges in Guatemala and expansions of that deal. Is this lawsuit directly related? If it's not directly related, is it related enough for us to use the same outside firm we used in the TOP dispute? What outside counsel were we using for the Texas Ohio Power dispute? Is this something you have time to work on? If not, let me know and I'll be happy to handle it. Thanks. ",

        "clean_content": " tjones.nsf The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years. As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors. With the higher volume, we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle. Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable. At times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone. In these cases we return the invoice to the vendor. If the employee is designated, we try to track him/her down and forward the invoice. The high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this increasingly challenging. Either way, we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices. To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through employee expense reports. By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and the turnaround time for payment of invoices.

Since we spoke last week, the meeting date has changed from February 20 to Monday, February 26 to better accomodate presentors' and attendees schedules. We have confirmed that this date works well for both you and Stan Horton. On the 26th, we will kick off the afternoon session with lunch at 12:15 PM, followed by your presentation from 1:30-2:30 and Stan's from 2:30-3:30. You are invited to have lunch with us and spend as much time with us that afternoon as your schedule allows. To follow up on our conversation last week, it would be great if you could talk to the group about Enron's performance in 2000, its successes and stumbles, and how ENE's stock price is impacted. It would also be helpful if you could discuss the look of Enron in 2001, what its primary busninesses are and how they drive earnings; as well as what significant initiatives Enron has planned for 2001. I have asked Stan to talk about ETS' performance during 2000, what he was pleased with and what lessons were learned. He also will share his perspective on how ETS fits into Enron's plans for 2001, as well as what initiatives and objectives are critical to ETS' success this year. Thanks again for taking time out of your schedule to spend it with the ETS HR team. I look forward to seeing you on February 26. Gary",

My assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget. I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

(\"ENA\") assigning some or all of its ISDA agreements entered into with Mexican counterparties to an Enron entity formed under the laws of Mexico (\"Enron Mexico\"). Such a transfer would cause ENA to be subject to U.S. federal income tax (at a 35 percent rate) on the value of the contracts assigned. As we discussed, one alternative may be for Enron Mexico to enter into new ISDA agreements with the Mexican counterparties, and to allow the ISDA agreements entered into by Mexican counterparties with ENA to lapse or, alternatively, to cancel such agreements. While such an alternative may be preferable from a U.S. tax perspective, other business concerns must also be considered (such as credit issues).

I want to get the process started to get ISDA's in place between Enron and these utilities. We are currently in the beginning stages of discussing financial trades with their legal counsel. Fortunately for Enron, I think we can have one attorney represent all 4 of PRM's clients. (FYI, that attorney will be Doug Rosenberg at Preston Gates & Ellis in Seattle.) To get started, I'd like Enron to forward to me copies of the ISDA agreement that you would propose as the starting point for discussions. I also ask that you send me a list/examples of any other documentation Enron will require (e.g., legal opinion, board resolution, etc.). Please send just one set of documentation at this point. I want to get the basic legal review process underway before you prepare four different sets of documents. I'd also like to request that when we get to the point of having Enron's attorney walk through the ISDA with our attorney, that Enron use Sara Shackleton. Sara was great to work with when we went through this for Merced, and I think she'd be extremely helpful once again as we venture into new territory with these 4 utilities. Thanks for your help.

Enron now has that ability. 4) We don't have the 1991 ISDA Definitions or the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions cited in Parts 5 and 6 of the Schedule to the Master Agreement.

        "clean_content": "URGENT: Draft Turbo Park EPC contract comments I attach legal comments produced by David Lund and myself over the holiday to the Turbo Park EPC Draft No. 3 sent to us last week. I also attach the clean and compared forms of the Turbo Park contract on which we based our comments and a chart of the proposed Turbo Park structure. I understand that these documents are intended to be confidential and are not to be shared with third parties, including vendors, subcontractors, or other counterparties. For the benefit of the EECC and NEPCO people who have not been involved in the discussions yet, Turbo Park is intended to be a \"9710 compliant off-balance sheet financing structure\" that would allow not only equipment purchases but also project construction to be financed and executed off-balance sheet. The form EPC will be to some extent pre-approved by the lenders for use with the Turbo Park facility. Although EECC/NEPCO are just now getting involved, I understand that the Turbo Park team needs to get some level of sign-off on the EPC by this Friday, presumably so that they can finalize their documentation with the banks. The degree of sign-off and the ability to make changes after that sign-off is unclear to me, but at this point I am not aware of any particular construction project that the form must be made to fit by Friday. [I have not been provided with any forms of attachments, and suspect that none need to be produced by this Friday. Roseann or Sheila, could you find out from your teams if this is the case?] Larry Izzo has asked that Peter Nassab have John Rigby get involved in the review of the attached contract, and that Dick Westfahl be made aware of the matter since NEPCO will be the contractor for these projects as a general rule. David Lund has asked that Gene Larson look it over for NEPCO. I suggest that you start with the attached comments before you launch into the drafts themselves. We are arranging a meeting with ENA and Enron Global Finance to coordinate discussion of these comments, any additional comments from EECC and NEPCO, and what EECC and NEPCO should expect from the Turbo Park project in the near term, and will get back to you as soon as this is arranged. With any luck at all, this effort will lead to a standard from not ionly for use with Turbo Park, but also for general use between EECC/NEPCO and ENA, and thereby significantly reduce transactions costs and time going forward. Roseann and Sheila, please forward this as appropriate to your respective team members and let us know when you have had a chance to digest the changes. 1. EECC/NEPCO legal comments 2.

Early next week will be bringing you a DASH approved by RAC recommending selling our interest in the PEMEX EPC 63/64 projects in the Gulf of Mexico to Horizon Offshore . We believe this an extremely good deal for Enron. In essence, it returns our equity and working capital funding for this project plus halts our risk and improves our project margin by $1.5 to $2 million. By the terms agreed, we will receive $25.6 million in cash and a complete release and indemnity from liability. We have a performance bond which at minimum will be protected back-to-back by an identical bond from the same bonding source, but it is likely Horizon can assume our bond. This is such a good deal you might wonder why Horizon would do it. Since January we have been playing hardball with both Horizon and Pemex. Horizon is public and their stock has been rising as a oil company service provider. This project is 35% of their volume. We believe they cannot afford a wobble with Pemex due the potential impact on their share price. We see no upsides for us on these projects. Prior to this collection EEOS year-to-date has $102 million of net postive cash flow versus a 2001 plan of $83 million. We now believe we will finish the year at $150 million positive. A little bright spot from NEPCO and the EECC Collection Agency. If you have questions, I am here and Brian will be in Houston on Monday. Keith Dodson",

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to satisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000. The Commission notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and its neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and configuration. The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a lack of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; theyfailed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs. The order states that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmission organizations reflecting natural markets. The Commission indicates that they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West. Therefore the order requires the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discussions as set out in the mediation order. Note that these meetings will start next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ. The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope characteristics of Order No. 2000. The order finds that Southern's approach to focus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate. The order states, \"We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in theSoutheast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.\" The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may be more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market development, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesale electricity prices. The order therefore directs the parties to the mediation as stated above. The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is starting on next Tuesday. It is a lengthier order with more details on other aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managment, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM. Therefore, I amattaching a summary of the order. One of the important findings of the order is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board. Therefore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and file a compliance filing within 90 days. If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know. ",

Relative to the approved 11/30 DASH, the major changes in the deal structure are as follows: 1. At the request of Coral Energy, the counterparty to the proposed transaction has changed from Coral Energy to Intergen (or its designated affiliate, Sweetgum Energy L.P.). 2. Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the removal of the requirement for an Intergen Parent Guarantee. The major risk (i.e. non-payment risk) associated with the removal of this Guarantee has been mitigated by requiring Intergen to fund an escrow account with the transaction sales proceeds prior to Enron's execution of the equipment Assigment Agreement. 3. Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the insertion of a \"no-shop\" clause which serves to prevent Enron from offering/soliciting the turbines & transformers to other parties once Intergen has signed the Letter Agreement(s). 4. Enron has requested, and Intergen has not yet agreed, to the modification of the transaction \"sunset dates\". These are the dates by which, once the Letter Agreement is signed, that Enron must deliver the required Facilities Agreements, GE acknowledgement letter, and fully executed Assignment Agreement. This modification proposes that the dates be moved from 12/29/00 to 1/15/01. The Enron commercial deal team is awaiting confirmation from Enron Global Finance that the executed Assignment Agreement can be delivered within these timeframes. 5. Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to a modification of the Transferability section of the Agreement in order to address an equipment warranty risk that the current language represents to Intergen. The modification would serve to limit Enron's ability to exercise its \"put option\" on its 20% member interest in the turbine/transformer L.L.C.(s) by requiring either: 1) the expiration of the GE warranty, or 2) the written consent of GE to Enron's ownership transfer in a form acceptable to Intergen. This modification is acceptable to Enron as it represents an earlier potential put option exercise date under scenario 1) above than the current Agreement language. Please review this information and let me know (via email) if RAC requires the DASH to be revised and re-approved. Call me to discuss. Fred x35406 ",

        "clean_content": "RW separations Michelle, Please let know what you thing regarding the following: 1) Two of the RW employees have called asking about their Cobra coverage and whether or not they are due money for the coverage. One could argue ( and they obviously are ) that health and welfare coverage constitutes part of their employment and should be paid to them as part of their separation. If we provide it to one then we really need to be consistent and apply it to everyone. I'm sure they are speaking to each other on a daily basis. 2) Russell Gilardi's attorney has made comment that one could interpret his contract to mean that he has a fixed term contract through the end of the year. Here is the wording verbatim: 'Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter, both you and the Company will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to terminate your employment, such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st January 2001.' I think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the separation agreements. For your info, other RW employees with this particular type of wording had their contracts fully paid out. 3) Joel Insinga is requesting that his non-compete be reduced from 6 months to 3 months. He was with MG for a little over a month. I've asked the SVP of the division for his thoughts and should hear something tomorrow. Thanks and hopefully we are nearing the end.! Cathy ",

Please consult this folder at the beginning of every shift to determine whether you have any trades to clear up and how many. Sometime over the course of your shift, take a minute to address the discrepancy, make strides to resolve it. If it happens to be more complicated than an \"intra-shift fix,\" talk to me so we can determine what needs to be done to expediate its resolution (pull tapes, pull our hair out, etc.) The most important step of this new procedure is post-op - TELL SOMEONE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. Sign the corresponding DMS sheet and write a legible explanation of measures taken on the back. Return it to Virginia, Mike, or me. Whatever you do, don't leave without a trace. I'd like to know if this sounds like a feasible plan; so feedback is welcome. In the meantime, this procedure will be effective immediately. Some of you already have disputes in your files.....Enjoy.

I put in a lot of language that we would need to look at the history of the industry to see how unusual and infrequent a change of that nature would be. If you all disagree I will change it to not be an extraordinary item. #3 I removed the sale of property from Jeff's spreadsheet. On page 354 of the book it says that \"other gains or losses from sale or abandonment of property, plant, and equipment used in a business\" is never an extraordinary item. #4 Since there was not a consensus on how to deal with the litigation costs. I put in a few sentences that handle both circumstances. Please look at it and ensure that it makes sense. Anyway, here it is.

Recently our internal compliance folks have discussed the \"give-up risk\". Specifically, what guarantee do we have that the executor's (Enron) FCM will accept the block trade and get it to the exchange on behalf of our clients? There is some concern that there might be limits imposed by the FCM due to issues such as credit and the high volatility of NG. They have requested we sign a four (or more) party give-up agreement between Campbell, Enron, your clearing firm(s) and our clearing firm(s). Is this the SOP as you envision the NYMEX EFS? We are at the point where the specific documentation issues are the main obstacles to moving forward. If we buy 1,000 NG from you, how do we know your FCM can guarantee acceptance of the trade for further give-up? Your legal feedback is welcome.

The template on which to list the information has been modified pursuant to suggestions by several people, and the final template (in Excel format) is attached hereto (see \"RegFilingForm\" below). Some of you have already sent me responses to earlier drafts (which are already included on \"RegFilingsMaster\" below), but please re-complete the form as necessary to include information in the added columns. We intend to ultimately be able to \"sort\" the entries by various categories (company, agency, state, etc.) so that we can generate partial lists for particular purposes. In addition to the spreadsheet, we are also going to put together a \"desk book\" about such filings, which will include a copy of the relevant forms and any instructions regarding the completion and filing of such forms. So please also send me a copy of forms/reports which you file with agencies for inclusion in the desk book. Since rules and forms obviously will change from time to time, the desk book will be in loose leaf form to allow for easy updating. Attachment \"RegFilingsMaster\" shows what information I have previously received and already incorporated into the form. Please use Attachment RegFilingForm to make any additions, and I will have it incorporated into the master spreadsheet. If there are any corrections or deletions which need to be made on RegFilingsMaster (e.g., if we no longer make LRC/Bridgeline filings), please tell me that as well.

Per our discussion, I've enclosed three files that include an invitation, agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at Insead. If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any questions, please email: Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or you can call him at 215-898-1231. This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that Enron's involvement will give the company access to some of the early research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of the partnership \"benefits.\" Our next upcoming events are scheduled for: Friday, September 8 \"WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?\" This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited. We will co-sponsor this with Wharton's major e-Business initiative. Major issues addresses include \"New Economics of the Web\" and \"Internet, Anywhere.\" Friday, October 20 \"FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES\" Designed by the ET core group and presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum. As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the Emerging Technologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf of our core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to join the program. To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the symposium in Paris on June 10 to \"test drive\" the program. I'll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your convenience, should you agree that Enron's participation in the ET Program would be of value. Please call or email if you have any comments or questions. best regards, Michael - Insead workshop Invitation lett - Insead Workshop Agenda1.doc - RSVP form.doc Michael S.

        "clean_content": " mlokay.nsf The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years. As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors. With the higher volume, we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle. Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable. At times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone. In these cases we return the invoice to the vendor. If the employee is designated, we try to track him/her down and forward the invoice. The high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this increasingly challenging. Either way, we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices. To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through employee expense reports. By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and the turnaround time for payment of invoices. Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide web-based expense reporting system similar to what Enron International has used for the past year. This will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement. We'd like to make this effective immediately. If you have any questionsor suggestions, please contact the Accounts Payable department.",

Without being impractical, something more than \"Oil & Gas exploration in Mexico\" (by way of example) is requested.

        "clean_content": " geoff storey 6-26-02.PST As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently. Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee. This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees. The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11. Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections. Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain. From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun. Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed. We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future. Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week. This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company. By now, you must have heard of \"NETCO.\" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business. Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership. We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO. It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO. The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder. We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January. As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention. This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee. We will update you periodically on our process. Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization. Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley. Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee. Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently. In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp. Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis. Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development. In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation. Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon. Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM. As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan. Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December: Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO. We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling. Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term. We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process. We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.",

        "clean_content": "Organization Announcement Enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide. Historically, the Company has conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented, decentralized manner allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance. Today, however, with the implementation of SAP and the profound explosion in internet/intranet-based technologies, we believe the Company should change its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically sourcing these requirements on a global basis. We believe that there are significant cash savings to be extracted by the Company and also commercial potential for the formation of a highly profitable, business-to-business e-Commerce venture. Effective February 1, 2000, Enron will form a new Global Strategic Sourcing unit. This new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic sourcing initiatives underway in the Gas Pipeline Group, Global Asset Operations and Enron Corp. Initially, Global Strategic Sourcing will focus on aggregating Enron's internal, joint venture and business partner demand for products and services with the objective of creating a future business-to-business e-Commerce venture. It gives us great pleasure to announce that George Wasaff, Managing Director, will lead this new global initiative. George will report directly to Mike McConnell, Chief Executive Officer for Global Technology. George has been with Enron for fourteen years and has held many senior executive positions, the most recent of which was Managing Director of ENRON South America's Wholesale Operations. George was also the Interim Chief Executive Officer of Elektro from July 1998 through June 1999 and Chief Executive Officer of Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (\"TGS\") from June 1995 through February 1998. George has also held numerous commercial positions including Vice President and Country Manager, Mexico for Enron International and Vice President of Marketing for Transwestern Pipeline Company. Please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating George in his new role with the Company. ",

Again, my reasoning is not based on a ctrprty-by-ctrprty check, but rather because I researched the code and criteria with the programmer and have been satisfied that the reports are performing as they should. Part of the alarm on Q2 numbers was caused by us not knowing which deals were included under the \"WSPP\" contract and trying to tie out with a different data pull. The only questions that remain for me are: how is the decision made to include deals under the \"contract number?\" How does that decision process get passed on to people as employees change? What is automated about it? My questions should not imply that I think the process is awry - I simply don't have enough of an understanding of the process to adequately answer those questions.",

        "clean_content": " skean.nsf While incentivizing the deal may be helpful from a business perspective, I'm not sure it will do much with the timing at the SEC. As you know, there are two major issues: (i) the integration, which we believe we have more or less under control, and (ii) the capital structure of the resulting system, which is dependent in the first instance on the timing of the Sierra auction. The cap structure is a very serious issue. There is a perception on the part of the staff that Sierra is significantly overextended. As you know, the SEC generally requires registered holding companies to maintain a minimum of 30% common equity. Currently, the best that Sierra can offer is that they will be at 20.8% common equity at closing, with a representation that Sierra will increase its consolidated common equity to approximately 29 percent as a result of: (a) proceeds from the sale of generating assets of Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power aggregating approximately $1 billion, 100 percent of which will reduce debt of the consolidated company; (b) proceeds from divestiture of non-core assets, or some combination of common equity and divestiture of non-core assets, which together would be approximately equivalent to the issuance of $260 million in terms of impact on Sierra Pacific's equity ratio; (c) issuance of up to $600 million of hybrid securities; and (d) increased retained earnings realized from the combined operations of Sierra and PGE aggregating approximately $80 million in 2000 and $100 million in 2001. In other matters, the SEC staff has indicated that it would give \"credit\" toward equity capitalization if the company has executed definitive agreements for sale of the subject assets. What is the status of the Sierra auction, and how quickly will they have signed agreements? Concerning state issues and the intervenorts, Steve Oldham and the folks from Skadden are meeting with the GC of the Nevada Commission (at his request) next week to clean up the Nevada issues so I don't think that will be a problem. What remains is the monkey wrench intervenors throw into any 1935 Act proceeding. Regardless of how successful we are on the above issues, the presence of the California intervenors means that the matter must be presented to the full SEC for consideration. Because of the delays inherent in that process, we will need all FERC and state issues resolved by September, or early October at the latest, in order to have a realistic chance at a year-end order. The only other thing that might prove helpful would be a price escalation provision so we could tell the SEC that there is a significant cost associated with their failure to act in FY 2000. There are a number of concerns with this approach: among other things, we would have to explain to the SEC why we're inserting it now. I realize this is a bit long-winded but it seems we're getting close to our last best shot at year end and I'd think we'd want to plan our strategy carefully. Best, Joanne >>> <Dwight.Larson@enron.com> 08/16/00 10:20AM >>> A meeting with Walt Higgins has been scheduled for Thursday in Las Vegas and attendees from Enron will be Mark, Mitch and Steve. The discussions will probably be more global than specific, however I'ld like everyone to forward to me their wish list of items so I can summarize them for Mark prior to their meeting. I'ld also appreciate input from everyone on the impact of amending the stock purchase agreement ( i.e. incorporating some incentive type payment if the deal closes this year) and the sensitivity to the timing of that amendment. What is the impact if it is done 1) prior to OPUC settlement, 2) prior to the Oregon Commission ruling, or 3) before or after the FERC addresses our filing. After collecting peoples input, I'll circulate the summary this afternoon. Paul , could you please forward this to Mike Morgan - I didn't have his e-mail address. thanks dwight ",

Phone charges: Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost center where possible; otherwise to the rent location. If you are being charged for phones/lines/services, etc. not belonging to you, or the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, please contact the Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\" or move-team@enron.com and place a request for the disconnection of that line, hardware, or service. Data connections: One connection is being charged for each room instead of one connection for each port in a room. EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB, 2AC, 3AC, or JF. For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose. People-specific services are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's SAP company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the resource using the service. EIS bills services on a one month lag. We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the SAP company and cost center for each employee. This snapshot is taken about the 21st of each month for use as a source for billing information. If the billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting FMS/EPSC or the person should be moved to the correct SAP company/cost center by contacting an HR representative.",

As there were many items discussed, but only a very few requiring insertion into the BETA and FA, I hope that I covered them all. I have also attached clean versions of these agreements. If the documents meet with your approval, please have two originals of each document printed for signature by an authorized officer of APB, being sure to attach the final form of the Exhibit A to each original of the FA. Once each document is signed and dated (and the Password is completed in the FA), please fax a copy of each agreement to Bob at 713-646-2126. Enron will countersign the faxed copy and forward a copy to your attention via fax. The originals should also be forwarded to Bob so that they can be physically countersigned by Enron. Please let me know if there is anything further that either of you should need. Thanks for the continued cooperation on this matter.

As you know, Enron (Dutapar), Copel, and Petrobras are the three shareholders of Compagas. Copel has as interest (along with El Paso) in the power plant which would use the gas. A contract has already been signed between Compagas and the plant. The Compagas Board votes on the agreement tomorrow. The gas supply contract would have a 20-year term and would be worth $1.2 billion. The ground for the suit would be that, under Brazilian law, Compagas is required to solicit bids for the gas supply arrangement. Compagas has sought to justify not soliciting bids on the basis that Petrobras is the only supplier capable of supplying the gas. This is incorrect: Enron, among others, is also capable of supplying the gas. We have a legal opinion supporting our position. and have called for a special shareholders' meeting to discuss the issue. We anticipate that Petrobras and Copel, despite their obvious conflict of interest, will force the issue and will vote in favor of the agreement nonetheless. Tozzini Freire has been advising us, and is doing an excellent job. If you approve, we would like to continue to use them if litigation is necessary. Please call me or Randy with any comments or questions. Thank you. ",

To try to prevent this argument, you will note that we have put preservation language in the arbitration statement of claim. We will need to do some additional legal research to make sure that would do the trick.

As drafted, we think the confidentiality agreement is overly broad, and potentially could limit our ability to speak with and participate in other ECNs.

Using this methodology, we prevent putting ourselves in the position where we need to worry about the broad definition currently contained in your agreement every time we speak with a competing ECN.

There have been many great ideas and suggestions on how to handle the new reorg. There is one thing to remember in all of this, we are still a team and even though you have your own p&l for whatever region that you are responsible for we are all still responsible for Enron. Below is a list or guidelines on how to handle the different situations. The hourly books are Northeast Hourly, Midwest Hourly, Southeast Hourly, and Ercot Hourly. There is no more Short Term Hourly or Short Term Hourly Management. 1. Any incremental deals that are done will go into the P&L and EnPower under the SINKS region and at the end of the shift there will be an annuity done between the appropiate regions. For example: AEP-TVA-SOCO Everything will go in the Southeast Hourly book. Then Southeast Hourly will do an annuity to give Midwest Hourly their share. Everything will be split down the middle. 2. Any positions that we inherit will go into the region where the position is and then there will be a Book Transfer done to balance everyone. For example: ENWC is long 100 mw's. The transmission and sell will go in the Midwest Hourly P&L and Book in EnPower and then a Book Transfer will be done between Midwest Hourly and whatever book that the position is in. 3. We had a situation today where Hourly Northeast wanted to buy the ENWC position to take to PJM and his bid was better than the market. The correct way to handle this would be that Hourly Midwest to sell Horly Northeast the power at ENWC. Hourly Northeast would put a buy from Midwest Hourly, the transmission, and the PJM sell in the Northeast Hourly book and P&L. Midwest Hourly would put a sell to Northeast Hourly in their P&L and book and then would do a Book Transfer with the responsible book of the ENWC position. It is very important that we learn EnPower like the back of our hands. Tresa Allen's group will no longer baby sit us, it is now our responsiblity. It is crucial that you understand what book that positions are in, Some positions could be in multiple books. Corry has told me that the scheduler's will try to put what books are responsible for what positions on their lotus notes that they put out. You can also look the deals up in EnPower. EnPower is a process that shows how acurate you are and whether or not you can pay attention to detail. If you have any questions please let me know I am available 24/7. Thanks Kayne ",

Right now, we are in the midst of several internal control reviews related to various risk areas. We are currently testing the risk that NNG and TW reserves (regulatory, legal contingencies, etc.) are inappropriately valued and/or established. One of the controls that Accounting cited to mitigate this risk was that both Legal and Rates reviewed the NNG and TW FERC Form No. 2s prior to issuance. Harry Walters and Allen Joe mentioned to us that there is no formal \"sign-off\" or approval process by Legal and Rates of the Form 2s, but instead, drafts were sent to the groups and any comments were then reviewed with Accounting. Your names were mentioned as those they sent the 1999 Form 2 drafts to for Legal to review (Maria-NNG and Susan-TW). In order for us to test this control, we need to confirm with your group that this type of review was performed for the 1999 NNG and TW Form No. 2s.

        "clean_content": " skean.nsf Friday, January 12, 2001 By the end of the day, the Treasury had decided to move forward and hold another meeting with the CEOs, Governor Davis and various other Government officials. Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video conference was set up with two locations: one at DOE in Washington and one in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage. It was tentatively set up for 2:30 pm CST. I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron. Long-Term Forward Contracts Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm. It includes a draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1. Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California. Debt and Forebearance Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday. QF Contract Reformation Parties continued discussion No information was available by COB Friday. Major Issues State interest in resolving State willingness to raise retail rates Utilties' desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager Willingness to \"call off the dogs\" for the suppliers and to release them from legal action State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation Next Steps If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting, this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the week of Jan 15. If agreement is reached, a massive amount of work is required immediately, such as: FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16. RFO completion and release by Jan 18 Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 2.

        "clean_content": "Cuiaba Call--legal issues 1. Consent Issue: Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) reported that he met with Furnas this week. Furnas had not received EPE's letter addressing the consent issue. Furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law. Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, Electronorte. 2. Arbitration considerations: Bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador. He consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration. What concerns me, however, is his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to seek political assistance. My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at the end of which we have the option to terminate. This buys us a little time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate. I'm not sure what reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet. I am not sure what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or express waivers related to timing in this regard). I committed that we would advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with respect to arbitration/litigation. I want to make sure they understand every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own way. Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who represents them. 3. Force Majeure: Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE does not have a valid force majeure claim. Based on my reading of the contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c). However, I'm told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action. Laine Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position. Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both parties have the right to terminate. No one buys the plant and we're stuck. I'll find out the date of our last FM notice. There have been several. 4. Budget: Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week, what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out. We may want to consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it. I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it. It needs to be subject to review as we go along. 5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice. We certainly have some conflicting views. Our experience in the Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway. If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said. Who knows. Please give me your comments or just call me. I'm open to any suggestions. John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I may be unaware of with any strategic plan. Regards, Michelle ",

        "clean_content": " JSTEFFE (Non-Privileged).pst This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals. The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done. These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is \"significant potential for undue discrimination\" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative. Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny. FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the \"linchpin\" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates. During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was \"important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side,\" that \"all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines.\" Last week's proclamation should be considered \"a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend,\" he asserted. In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties \"are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk\" of such unequal treatment. FERC declared that a \"key factor\" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an \"appropriate material deviation\" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide \"adequate alternatives\" to other shippers. In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs. The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, \"we have reconsidered that holding\" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order. Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an \"adequate alternative,\" the commission observed. \"However, if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not include any such provision.\" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk, giving it \"an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,\" the commission pointed out. \"A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,\" FERC said, adding that \"such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.\" Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights \"is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated\" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language \"will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.\" Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become \"muddled.\" Through a \"tortured line of cases,\" FERC's definitions of allowable contracting practices were \"obscured,\" Breathitt said in welcoming the new \"common-sense\" approach. The \"tug of war\" that parties have engaged in over the past few years \"really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service\" are available to all shippers, she said.",

The department shall provide public notice when the department has fully satisfied the net short position of an electrical corporation. This event shall be deemed to be the close of the initial subscription period for the applicable electrical corporation. c) If, after the initial subscription period has closed, a large commercial or industrial customer elects to leave the department service, the department may impose a fee equal to the incremental costs imposed on the portfolio that are directly related to the load of the departing customer. d) Upon conclusion of the initial subscription period, the department shall notify all large commercial and industrial customers no less than six months in advance of the lapse of any long-term contract. Upon such notice large commercial and industrial customers shall have the right to elect an alternate provider without being subject to the surcharge set forth in sub-section (c). This event shall be deemed to be an open subscription period and shall remain in effect until such time as the aggregated demand of all customers electing an alternative provider exceeds the capacity of the lapsing contract. This event shall be deemed to be an open subscription period. e) If a large commercial or industrial customer requests service from the department after the initial subscription period or outside of an open subscription period, the department may impose a fee equal to the incremental costs imposed on the portfolio that are directly related to the load of the returning customer, taking into account prospects for load growth in its customer base, compared to the total value of the portfolio of energy used to serve the customer. f) Customers that have elected to take service from the department after the initial subscription period or outside of an open subscription period shall be required to take service from the department for a minimum of one year. g) Any new customer to the service territory of an electrical corporation shall have the opportunity to elect service from the department without being subject to sub-section (e). h) Any new customer shall have the opportunity to elect service from an alternative provider during the first 120 days from the date of service initiation without being subject to sub-section (c). i) For purposes of this section, residential and small commercial customers shall be defined as customers with demands less than 100 kW. j) For purposes of this section, commercial and industrial customers shall be defined as customers with demands equal to or greater than 100 kW. k) For purposes of this section, a long-term contract shall be defined as a contract for energy greater than or equal to one-year in length. l) For purposes of this section, incremental costs shall be defined as the costs that the department cannot reasonably avoid until such time as one or more long-term contracts expire",

Well, its finally ready to roll out, just in time for your light weekend reading!! Currently the Steel Group confirms short term deals using a 12 page GTC and the Forest Products Group confirms deals using a 1 1/2 page GTC. The attached unified form GTC represents a compromise between Steel and Forest Product; that is, its length is a miniscule 5 1/2 pages (excluding the Claims Procedure Appendices). Aside for shrinking the Steel GTC and lengthening the Forest Products GTC, the new EIM GTC addressed parties' contracting rights if a Trade Event involving the imposition of trade duties or import/export restrictions messes up the economics of a Transaction. As you all know, imports of Steel and Lumber into the U.S. are very sensitive issues that the Commerce Department, President and Congress are currently assessing and will act on within the next 5 months. Legal has taken feedback and used it to craft a bilateral arrangement that acknowledges the effect of Trade Events. Please let us know if this bilateral approach works for you. The new EIM GTC addresses, in greater detail, how parties must proceed making claims as to defective products (i.e., a Defect Claim). While I have received helpful suggestions from Del Davis and John Daniel, this area is the one that varies the most widely between Steel and Forest Products (as well as within the various commodities offered by such Groups). Therefore it is the area that needs the most input and work from logistics, insurance and others that deal with these types of problems. Keep in mind that any solutions you make should have a bilateral slant to them, as EIM will be both a Buyer and a Seller. Too hard a position taken either way will come back to haunt us. But please give me your input in this area--the pertinent sections are 6.1(c) and the 2 Appendices attached at the end. If we need more specialized Appendices for other Commodities, please provide me details for same. Legal would like the Documentation Group to make a mass mailing of the new EIM GTC to all current and former customers next week and start using the new GTC late next week, if possible. I remain available to take your comments, typo fixes, suggested changes, deletions, additions, etc. with the goal of finalizing this document by the end of the day next Tuesday. Please help me to meet that deadline by reviewing the attached as soon as possible. Finally, I will be forwarding a Short Form (1 page) Confirmation that Steel and Forest Products will be able to use once the new EIM GTC is implemented. We'll be able to abbreviate the Confirmation because all the FCPA, Governing Law, Assignment and non-deal terms will already be built into the GTC.

Thanks Molly -----Original Message----- From: Castano, Marianne Sent:Tuesday, November 20, 2001 11:16 AM To:Harris, Molly Cc:Keller, James; Smith, Mike Subject:NIMO/Notice RE: Posting of Additional Security Molly: Per your request, we did a bit of research regarding whether NIMO, pursuant to its gas tariff, can request additional security from us in light of the recent credit downgrades experienced by Enron Corp. Under NIMO's \"Supplier Select\" program, credit appraisals and security requirements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted \"as financial evaluations dictate\". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective August 1, 2000. NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amount of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor is at the minimum rating (listed as \"BBB\" from S&P or Fitch or \"Baa2\" from Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, Fitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guarantor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii)the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New Yorkutility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely payments to the utility. If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit rating is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement will be lifted. See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2. In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its securityrequirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutually agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash deposit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approvedby the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial institution with at least an \"A\" bond rating; (iii) asecurity interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a guarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit rating of at least \"BBB\" by S&P or Fitch or \"Baa2\" by Moody's; (v) payments made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which will reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be required); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adequate security. See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4. For your information, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) after providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails to pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy(or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its customers under NIMO's Supplier Select program. See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.7. No prior notice is required under (ii). Please call me re: the above if you have questions/need additional information. MLC ",

        "clean_content": " Stokley, Chris (Non-Privileged).pst Kristin - I just wanted to drop you a line since my last email communication last week to give you a status on our current activities for the Power Contract Validation/Reconciliation Project. 1. The Access Database that will be used for the validation and reconciliation processes is 70% complete. Our estimate is about 1.5-2 days for completion. The main issue slowing the development process is that we are still trying to identify all of the required fields for a complete Power contract. After doing so, we will need to go back to the folks working with Scott Mills to do another RPS data extraction. 2. Toby Ellis' group has been working to gather paper contracts from the Legal Dep't, CSC, and Origination so that we have all of the sources necessary for validation and reconciliation. As further contracts are generated and/or located, they are copied and on a daily basis, we are to meet with Scott Watson mid-afternoon for ongoing collection. 4. Leveraging the experiences of the Gas Project, we are currently documenting the processes and procedures that the staff personnel will use to actually execute the validation and reconciliation procedures. This should ensure a smooth transition for them. I will look for Chris', Murray's, and your recommendations for these at some point by end of week. 5. We are currently ramping up the staff involved with this project. By week-end, we should have about 7-8 staff personnel on board. Finding a physical location for everyone will be difficult. Murray O'Neil, Chris Stokley, and one of the office managers in 3 Allen are aware of this need and its urgency, and are working with me to arrange the space. Please let me know if you have any questions about the above. I can be reached at any of the numbers/locations below. Thanks. > kpmg LLP Information Risk Management Joshua P.

The case will end up tried in Indiana and is governed by Indiana law. Wayne Gresham, who works for the coal group and happens to have practiced in Indiana, suggested that we use a litigator named Dan Kelley. Dan works at Wayne's former firm, Ice, Miller, Donadio & Ryan. Dan's conflicts check revealed that Ice, Miller represents the Simon Property Group in various contract negotiations involving EES. Apparently, Simon is a long standing client of Ice Miller and has consented to Ice Miller's representation of Enron in the NIPSCO dispute as long as, in the event a dispute arises between Simon and Enron, Enron will consent to the simultaneous adverse representation of Ice Miller or agrees to allow Ice Miller to withdraw from representing Enron to represent Simon. Dan has no personal involvement with Simon and is unaware of any potential dispute between Enron and Simon. So far, Dan seems like a very competent lawyer who has been not only responsive to requests for quick turn around but also has shown a lot of \"coal savvy\" which will be quite helpful to us. To the extent that we don't have any other connections in Indiana and I hope we won't be having any other litigation there, I don't see an immediate problem with the requested waiver. I ran this by Richard who was OK with it as well. Please let me know if you are OK with this. I've copied Vicki Sharp on this note so that she can let us know if she is aware of anything between Enron and Simon that might be looming on the horizon. Thanks in advance. ",

The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities. There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation. 86M - Enron Net Works LLC Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company. Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else. The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg. 80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc. This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger. Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items. 83N is my responsibility. I think this entity should stay with 83N. So I suggest it be assigned to Leon. It should be 4 - easy. 1579 - EBS Network Co. Division of 17H. This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group. Not currently on our list of companies. I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon). 4 - easy. 1691 - EPI-EBS Europe Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities. Broke out the activities of 1179. A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well. 4 - easy. 1307 - EBIC-Apache, LLC Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF, a CFC. Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker). Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax. 4 - easy. 1689 - EPI-EBS Ventures, LLC Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.

Namely, GridFlorida must improve stakeholder participation; must report on further developments to ensure obligations of reliability and interface functions according to Order 2000; and must further define the rights of passive owners understanding that any veto rights of passive owners will be subject to review by FERC. RT01-67 Southwest Power Pool's application to form an hybrid RTO is rejected. SPP's application was limited to Entergy and SPP only and therefore, has not meant the scope and regional configuration as directed by Order 2000. The required report according to the Federal Power Act, Section 203 was not filed. The order does permit SPP to change its merger affiliation to join an RTO and approves the filing regarding the board selection process. RT01-34 FERC is issuing a Notice, RM99-2 inviting comments from the industry on interregional coordination. A technical conference will be scheduled after comments are received. FERC has been disappointed in the filings with regard to the interregional participation; hence, the Notice. CPUC v. El Paso, RP00-241. This order discusses CPUC's complaint that ElPaso Merchant intentionally acquired more capacity than needed to manipulate price spreads. The order dismisses denies summary judgment and dismisses the complaint. FERC stated that El Paso Merchant has not violated any standards of conduct.

        "clean_content": " jdasovic.nsf Jeff: Goodin, MacBride is willing and able to represent a coalition of end-users, marketers, and other interested parties in the PG&E Gas Accord II proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in the GRI proceeding in both PG&E and SoCalGas settlements. We would propose to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between the parties who agree to join such a coalition. In exchange for joining the coalition, parties would receive frequent updates on the status of settlement talks and other proceedings, participate in conference calls to reach decisions on coalition positions, and have the ability to call on the GMSRD lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide any other useful information. I envision using several attorneys for various portions of the proceeding, including using associates and paralegals for research, and other GMSRD partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings, etc. However, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with Commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead partner on the case. I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys who would likely have some involvement in the case. Because the majority of this work will be done in 2001, these rates reflect our new 2001 hourly fees. However, in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition, and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing clients, we propose to reduce our standard fees with a 15% discount for all participants in the coalition. With this discount, these would be the lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year. I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the proceedings will be. Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful budgetary estimates. If you require some type of estimation sooner than that, please let me know. Thank you for your interest in using our services. Please contact me directly at (415) 765-8408 if you have any questions.

        "clean_content": "NNG Hubbard Stuart, I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements: All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name 1. Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one. We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings. NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement) This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities. No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable. No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). Thus it is not terminated. If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year. Term is through January 31, 2018. 2. First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997. NNG operates the electric driver for ENA. Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater. Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above. Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period). No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 3. Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997. ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative. Term is through December 31, 2017. No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 4. Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995. ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69. Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default. GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default. If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the \"Stipulated Loss Value\" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder. The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement. Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements. ",

I realise this is a tight deadline and appreciate your cooperation in addressing these concerns, which have only just recently come to light. 1) In the attached spreadsheet, identify the GTC which covers each Product Type for the GTC's which you have written. note I have completed the first U.S. Natgas as an example. Please email your update on this spreadsheet to Andrew Thomas. 2) The MasterProductData Spreadsheet (MPS) is attached. It contains a tab called Shortdesc. This tab shows a list of Product Types and an index of Product Additional Information (PAI) fields which apply to each Product Type. There are further tabs on the spreadsheet which correspond to the PAI's. The descriptions which appear to the customers on the website will be comprised of the Product description on the LongDesc tab and the descriptions from the applicable parts of the applicable PAI tabs. I have confirmed that this spreadsheet contains all comments received to date, excluding financials, which we are working on seperately. Following is a suggested process: - List all of the variables in the GTC which would need to be quantified or defined in the MPS. Think of the MPS as being the equivalent of the trader's conversation with the customer (which is reflected in a final confirmation), which covers the commercial, specific terms of the deal. - Compare this list with the MPS. Confirm that the language of the MPS conforms with the requirements of the GTC. Rember to check both the Product description found on the LongDesc tab as well as the tabs for each of the PAI's for that Product. The PAI's for each Product are listed on the ShortDesc page. - Don't worry about any missing entries for index types, locations, etc. These should be filled for accuracy and completeness by the confirmations groups. Any changes you make to Products language will be incorporated into any new additions. - Make any changes on the spreadsheet using a red font to highlight and email it back to Andrew Thomas. 3) Once the above is complete, and all additions from the confirmations groups have been incorporated, we will email back a complete set for final approval.

        "clean_content": " jlavora.nsf John: I spoke with Tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the compensation proposal I sent last week. Before our conversation this morning I wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts I have which might help keep our discussion more focused. First, I think we've both been at Enron about the same amount of time and probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at Enron. In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans, compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies. Just as we all have to create our own path at Enron we generally must do our own research and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside Enron. In several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of the contracting process! In my opionion, this is mostly because of the lack of communication of any \"overall compensation plan\" which drives people to the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to do if information were available. Among the many ENA managers I have worked with none has ever explained any such \"plan\". Tim has indicated that there is some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and Dave Delainey are trying to adhere to. I would appreciate some discussion about this as it may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a contract without being 100% satisfied with the minimum amounts in the contract (primarily because we've experienced the verbal commitment which is forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle). Second, Tim indicated some concern about locking in certain minimum overall compensation levels and that \"if a person were to have a bad year there may be no room for bonus\". I think this is a real concern particularly when we consider a new trader from outside the company. In my case, while I currently don't have a specific book that gets marked each day, I think there is a clear record over the past seven years of significant value to ENA's west power business. This value comes in several forms: value above the offer/below the bid, market information driving both short and long-term value into our books, developing new markets and products for ENA, extending my market knowledge and deal structuring capabilities on a continuous basis each day to other origination/strucuturing/mid-market/real time groups, building a no-risk/high value Services business, and providing leadership to employees about their role at Enron or Enron's role in the market. All of these efforts are focused on adding mark-to-market value to ENA in more ways than any single, specific book can measure. I am certain that I will continue to add value in these ways and have little concern about this \"bad year\" scenario. Finally, I am trying to make sense of the proposed compensation that Tim has relayed to me. If I understand it correctly my cash compensation pay would change from $206k ($130 base /$56 COLA /$50 retention) over the past three years as a Director to a base pay of $170k as a Vice President with higher expections and increasing responsibilities. The equity plan that is currently available to Vice Presidents and above would be locked in at values of $175/$125. This one is a little hard for me to evaluate as it is new in its current form (I have been a participant in prior years of similar equity plans which have ranged in initial from $10k-$50k as a Director). Bonus would be determined annually, I assume under similar process as past years. The trouble I am having is evaluating a significant decrease in cash compensation after being promoted and locking in a known (versus unknown) value in an equity plan for which I presumably am already a participant in and for which there is little other plan information available to evaluate. I would appreciate your thoughts on this in relation to any overall compensation \"plan\". I'll look forward to our discussion. Greg",

        "clean_content": " shorton.nsf Dear Stan: I greatly appreciated the opportunity to meet with you on Tuesday, and recognize that the length of our meeting disrupted your schedule. I thank you for your frankness during our discussion. I do want to reiterate that the business operations of GRI and IGT are significantly different than those of a utility. In addition, the evaluation performed over the past six months has shown that the \"mechanical\" aspects of the merger are straightforward. I believe that basing a CEO selection dominantly on these two criteria would subject the merged entity to an unnecessary risk of failure. Critical to the success of the Institute will be its ability to deliver demonstrable value to its customers. All of the critical building blocks will exist at the combined Institute. To capitalize on this opportunity, the leader must be able to foster a creative, entrepreneurial environment in which integrated teams work in concert, not in strife. I encourage you to speak with members of both current and past organizations that I have headed to gage the level of excitement and commitment that I have been able to instill and my ability to create an atmosphere of mutual support and respect from an initial environment of conflict. My resume documents the bottom line profit/loss impact that results from these effective teams. During our discussion you asked if I could work effectively with Bill as the COO of the \"Institute.\" Not only is the answer clearly yes, I emphasize that even during last year when conflict between GRI and IGT became visible to DOE, Bill and I made joint visits and presentations to DOE and others to provide a ********************************************************************** ?united front? and mitigate adverse effects. During the past six months, I have had the opportunity to work closely with Bill and sincerely believe that he would provide a complementary set of skills and capabilities. The 300 people that will initially form the Institute deserve the maximum opportunity for success. I firmly believe that I have demonstrated the commitment, leadership skills and energy necessary to successfully merge the best aspects of GRI and IGT. I do not believe that you will be able to identify another individual that has as high a likelihood of forging an integrated team that will maximize the impact of the Institute on its current and future customer bases. I look forward to our continued interactions. Stan Borys",

For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical. Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept. The purpose of this note is twofold. First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here. I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly. Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts. I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York. Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor. At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family. I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!). Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward. Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work! Jay ",

I already had the spreadsheet, however, they were asking for additional information and since Diana was out I got kind of thrown in the middle of this one. Thank you for your help.

He will issue written order that calls for cutoff of all written discovery to be served on Jan 12 and answer by Feb 23. After Feb 23 fact witnesses can be deposed until July 31. From Aug 1 to Oct 15 expert discovery is to be completed. There will be certain months designated for plaintiff to take depos and other months for Defendants. Defandants get more months. Above is guestimate as Judge Zampano was still thinking about final dates etc. Most interesting part came at end of day when Judge talked to parties separately. Judge wanted to know what it would take to get group to discuss settlement. General consensus was that defendants wanted plaintiffs to be put to their proof on insolveny issue and provide basis for damages. Idea is that Judge will hold status conf on Jan 16 and will push that idea with the plaintiff. Obviously I think there is a good chance Enron will be out of it by then because I think the Plaintiff is very anxious to settlewith any party will ot sit down with the trustee. One last thing. Greenswag was nagging me aout Enron's payment of share of jt. defense costs. I said I would pass his request on to you--so I am.

Lay Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ENRON CORPORATION Dear Dr Lay, While it appears that the US economy is moving towards the much-talked about 'soft-landing', there are nevertheless imbalances - particularly the severe shortage of labor and surging trade deficit - which have given global business leaders reason to be wary. Add to this scenario the new political landscape, and the recent hike in oil prices, and there is every reason to pay close attention to the USA in early 2001. Taking place within the first 100 days of the new Administration, the USA Meeting 2001 will bring together key members of the cabinet and congressional leadership, several hundred chief executives from over forty countries, as well as renowned experts and media leaders. In our usual Davos-style interactive discussions, we will analyse the current state of the world's largest market against the backdrop of the global economy. Held in collaboration with the National Chamber Foundation, the USA Meeting takes place at the headquarters of the US Chamber of Commerce, across from the White House. The Meeting is widely recognised as the premier Washington event for business leaders from the United States and around the world. A full brochure will be sent to you after the election but wanted to take the opportunity to inform you at this early stage so you can already block April 4-5, 2001 on your agenda. I hope that I will have the pleasure of welcoming you in Washington, DC next April, and look forward to hearing from you soon.

When I retired in February my 10,000+ stock options had a value of about $265,000. At the price of the Enron/Dynegy merger, $10.41 per share, my options have zero value. I know that I am not the only employee/retiree in this position. The 1994 Stock Option Plan, as I read it, does not address what happens when a merger occurs that is approved by the board of directors. What happens now? Do the options die? Do the options get converted to Dynegy stock options in some fashion? I am interested in the answer but not optimistic. Over the years I and other employees were encouraged/enticed into taking part of our annual bonuses in the form of options. In taking these options, I relied on the integrity of the Enron executive leadership that their statements of the good financial shape of Enron were true. In retrospect it appears I should have cashed the options in when I had the chance. Even in early August I could have got close to $100,000 for my options. But again, I believed the statement that there was no bad news coming. The company has preached the values; R.I.C.E.- Respect, Integrity, Communication, and Excellence.

For what it is worth, outside counsel does have some concerns with just arbitrating the confidentiality issue. First, they raise the possibility that by only raising the confidentiality issue, we might be waiving the guaranty assignability issue. To try to prevent this argument, you will note that we have put preservation language in the arbitration statement of claim. We will need to do some additional legal research to make sure that would do the trick.

        "clean_content": "Alberta PPA Financing I thought I might try to sum up. It seems to me that we both need to finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of next week. 1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap structure including the credit and covenant package. 2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have one prepared. Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes. Frankly, unless and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations are, it is difficult if not impossible to prepare documentation. For example: (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee they were expecting from Enron Corp. I was trying to require the Bank to accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities. Based upon this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may have a problem to resolve. However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank. (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law. However, I now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law. (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable. (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to Enron Canada. Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal opinions. (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine. I suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable. (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed. (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank. This presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults. At the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be capable of being set-off. We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements. (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent upon a final understanding of the swap structure. (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap structure. Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate \"fee letter\" to recover its fees. More problematically, the Bank was not clear as to how \"increased costs\" would be accounted for in the swap structure. Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those increased costs are flowed through. They were not sure how this could be accommodated in a swap structure. I suggested that there may be some way to fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes or through a separate indemnification in the \"fee letter\". (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank. For example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the Bank in connection with the transaction. Of course this depends on finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants package. In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper as soon as possible. Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning. Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external expectations. It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday morning. Regards, Peter",

El Paso suggests the following information be collected: the name of the counter party to the financial trade the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates the date on which the deal was entered into the type of trade El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)

POWER - All sales customers except for 6 have been identified. We have transmitted (copy attached) all information with the exception of these 6 to Marshall Turner. We work tomorrow on resolving the 6, and will provide the data to Marshall at that time. Of course, these schedules are subject to a final review by Janet and Rogers. 3. NON-STANDARD DEALS - I do not have an update from last night, and per Marshall Turner, he has not received any additional schedules from Michelle since yesterday (Mondy, 12/17). What is the status of this filing? As a reminder, I need the current support from each group for the analysis and reason for rejection. As we agreed in the meeting this morning, Janet has asked that I be on point for gathering and retaining this. Please forward me your matrices that suppor this rejection filing. Janet: As Outlook was down most of today, I don't think anyone was able to get you the Power matrix. I do not have the most current one, but I have attached the one as of last Friday to provide you the format.

The unused stuff is made up of notes I made from Hamel, some news stories, press releases, and random thoughts. We probably won't use any of this stuff but I wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful. The challenge we face at this stage (and where I can most use your help) is in documenting Enron's risk management functions in a meaningful way.

We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call. IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first. We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors. As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this issue was \"In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.\" The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.

        "clean_content": " Germany, Chris.pst Mark- Sorry for the delay in getting this to you...I've been struggling to find some more concrete information to rest an analysis on, but until we see Transco's supplemental testimony and the Commission Staff's \"top sheets\", it's very hard to predict where the case will come out. Following, however, are some known variables that will effect the outcome of Transco's proposed increase: Rate of Return on Equity Transco filed for a 15.05% equity return (compared with the 12.4% recently affirmed by the FERC in the RP97-71 docket). Transco based their filed number on a restructured \"proxy group\", which was revised by their witness to include Kinder Morgan, ElPaso Energy Partners, and Northern Border Partners (these were added to ElPaso, Enron and Williams). Adding these entities has the effect of raising the high end of the range of DCF returns from 14.56& to 17.52% The effect of the 260 basis point increase to return on equity amounts to $61million, or approx. 27% of the requested increase. Protests on this issue were filed chiefly by the New York PSC and PSE&G. The NYPSC Protested mainly the change in the structure of the proxy group, citing the fact that the new entities added by Transco's witness are owned in substantial part by existing members of the proxy group. The NYPSC asked for an expedited hearing on the development of a new proxy group--FERC declined to establish an expedited hearing but did set this issue for the hearing to be conducted before Judge Harfield. PSE&G's complaint was based primarily on the fact that Transco cannot failed to demonstrate significant financial risk sufficient to justify the higher return rate. PSE&G cited Transco's continuance of SFV rate design as a risk mitigation factor that cannot allow Transco to seek a higher return. (PSE&G and UGI have indicated that they will be seeking a \"Substantial Shift\" from SFV rates in this case. They sought a 35% shift in the Texas Gas case. 1Line costs Transco's filing contains approx. $60million representing their allocation of costs for Williams new 1Line system. Several parties (including NYPSC, KeySpan, PECO) protested the level of costs, questioning the allocation of over 1/2 of the total costs to Transco. Transco's main risk with respect to these costs is the fact that the FERC accepted and suspended the 1Line tariff sheets until September 1, making it nearly impossible for Transco to move the system into production prior to the end of the RP01-245 base period. If Transco cannot demonstrate that the 1Line system is \"used and useful\" prior to the end of the base period, they will technically be unable to recover these costs in this docket. However, nothing precludes the costs being included in any settlement of the docket. Essentially, Transco will eventually recover these costs (whether at the $60m level or somewhere near that), but if they cannot get the system up and running prior to the end of the base period, they'd have to make a separate limited Section 4 filing to recover them. Roll-in Mobile Bay Transco included a roll-in of the $120m Mobile Bay project in this case, based on a previously granted predetermination in favor of roll-in from FERC The roll-in was protested by several LDC customers, who claimed that the $40m cost over run associated with the project represents enough of a change in circumstances to negate any presumption in favor of roll-in. SunBelt, Pocono & Cherokee Transco filed for prospective roll-in of these projects. The suspension order set out the appropriate Policy Statement to be applied to the projects, applying the 1999 Policy Statement which eliminates any presumption in favor of roll-in and places the burden of the costs squarely on the incremental shippers. Since roll-in is generally not a \"settleable\" issue, determination of this issue will be dependent on the outcome of the hearing. The main issue with respect to predicting the rate level for the 2001-02 season is that the FERC Staff has indicated that settlement discussions should not begin until all of the testimony rounds are completed and the Staff files it's top sheets...meaning that the motion rates could go into effect on September 1 before a single settlement session is held. Transco has indicated that they'd like to speed up the process so they can move rates into effect in September that reflect settlement progress. It's difficult to predict the net effect of disposition of these issues--but it's safe to assume that the FERC will act to bring the return number down to a level consistent with the January order, which would knock out 25-27% of the requested increase. I'll continue to update you as soon as any new information comes in or when I can get a better sense for what rate we'll be looking at for September. Please let me know if you have any questions.

        "clean_content": " skean.nsf DealBench Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online! The Product DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange and execute transactions efficiently and effectively. Companies that license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, track and close a transaction online. DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the transaction process for licensees: Document Sharing: deal-related materials in various formats (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures, etc.) can be uploaded for deal participants to view and/or edit. Auctioning/Bidding: licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender bids. Multi-media: customers can present high quality virtual road shows and asset descriptions using streaming video. Secure Communication: DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many communication. Deal Management: DealNotesTM enables customers to monitor the progress of their deals using statistics on user downloads, bidding/auction results and user page views. Applications DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for the new headquarters building. Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide for the hosting of online datarooms. To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding this Enron Net Works initiative.

Before coming to Enron as you recall, I worked with a New york based firm here in Houston where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.

The meeting is scheduled for approx. 2:00 p.m. through 5:00 p.m. We are going to be trying to get CDWR to negotiate and sign the EEI agreement we sent to them as part of our RFB package. We are also going to have our block forward positions documented in a Confirmation Letter under the EEI agreement and will ask them to negotiate and sign this letter too. Finally, we will give them a document which we will suggest they use to go to the banks which are holding the LC's related to the block forward trades, which document will facilitate the transfer of the LC's to CDWR's bank. The following people have been working together on various aspects of these negotiations, and may I suggest that the these people try to coordinate their efforts tomorrow morning as follows to help us when we get to the negotiation table: Shari Stack is going to prepare the Confirmation Letter showing our block forward trades. Monica Lande will confirm the positions and Steve Hall is going to help Shari make sure the Confirm is ready to fax to me in Sacramento around noon. Elizabeth is going to help us get appropriate language in the Confirm to address the situation that would arise if the transfer of the block forward trades ever falls apart. John Klauberg, working with Pat Boylston, is going to provide us with a Regulatory Out Clause for our EEI agreement. John, please e'mail the clause to Pat, Elizabeth and Steve Hall. Steve, please coordinate any comments on the clause and get it ready to fax to me by noon. Please communicate to me tomorrow morning through Steve Hall, 503-464-7795, or my pager at 800-449-7147.

This effort will include any needed side agreements. 2. Review any \"corporate\" or \"partnership\" ownership issues affecting any pipelines or segments within the assets. 3. Review of rights-of-way, easements, real property licenses, fees lands, leaseholds and other real property interests comprising the assets (explore possibility of obtaining help from ROW people within GPG). Analysis must include right-to-assign and no-conversion- of- common-carrier-assets-to-private-use issues, as well as other standard issues, including telecommunication rights, etc. 4. Physical inspection of real and personal property in the deal for safety/environmental/operating issues. 5. Tariff/FERC/regulatory/property tax issues affecting the assets. (Need to be sure that assets have been properly listed & reported to taxing authorities. Need to \"assume\" existing tariffs where required.) 6. HSR (antitrust) and \"shop closing\" issues. SEC disclosure issues, and relationship b/w Phoenix and Koch S-1. 7. Employee/benefit/organized labor issues (three unions/collective bargaining agreements involved). 8. Existing commercial contracts and \"shipper\" issues. Any long-term or \"out- of- the- money\" situations? 9. Any outstanding claims, assessments, levies, penalties, protests or litigation (both environmental and non-environmental). 10. Completion of any remaining business due diligence needed to confirm/justify purchase price. 11. Environmental review---with emphasis on \"pricing\" existing enviro matters we would be assuming/undertaking. 12. UCC lien search and any bulk sales issues. Of course, the list above is just for openers. There are a number of things I have undoubtedly missed. We have our standard check list that we use on these deals, and I know you will have a number of additional items you will want to include in the overall list.

I have had a chance to overlay this PWC projection of PG&E's revenue requirement to cover retained generation, QF and bilaterals, an estimate of the undercollection and the DWR revenue requirement to analyze the sufficiency (headroom) in current rates. Note, there is a outstanding rate case on the generation component of rates for the IOU's. I included three sections below. The first illustrates that unevenness of DWR's cash needs. The second displays the costs across all sales volumes. The third displays unit costs based on PG&E and DWR's revenue flows and their volumes provided. This analysis indicates that there is a slight amount of headroom for PG&E (0.254 cents). 1. The DWR Revenue Recovery allocated to PG&E is as follows (along with a Last Twelve Months running balance): Revenue Quarter Revenue (thd) LTM (thd) Q1 2001 $ 105,118 Q2 2001 $ 382,142 Q3 2001 $ 612,808 Q4 2001 $1,031,244 $2,131,312 Q1 2002 $ 924,185 $2,950,379 Q2 2002 $ 583,401 $3,151,638 Q3 2002 $ 695,644 $3,234,474 Q4 2002 $ 863,144 $3,066,374 2. Assuming the 2002 DWR revenue requirement, a large amount of undercollection recovery at $6 Bln ($8.5 Bln minus $2.5 Bln in cash) and using PWC's projection, across all amounts billed: Sales Rate Revenue (GWh) (per Mwh) ($ Bln) a) PWC Retained Gen, QF & Bilaterals 75,537 4.003 3.024 b) Amortize $6 Bln, 12 years at 7.5% 75,537 1.001 0.756 c) DWR requirement 75,537 4.059 3.066 d) Headroom in existing rates 75,537 0.254 0.192 e) Total 75,537 9.317 7.038 3. Looking at the revenue on the volumes provided (PG&E at 46,881 GWh and DWR at 28,656 GWh) yields: Sales Rate Revenue (GWh) (per Mwh) ($ Bln) a) PWC Retained Gen, QF & Bilaterals 46,881 6.451 3.024 b) Amortize $6 Bln, 12 years at 7.5% 46,881 1.613 0.756 c) DWR requirement 28,656 10.699 3.066 d) Headroom in existing rates 75,537 0.254 0.192 e) Total 75,537 9.317 7.038 Note interest is capitalized until Sept 1, 2002 and the principal payments into the Debt Service Account do not begin until March 1, 2003. If spot purchase curves do not move, there could be some relief by this price backwardation in 2003 from the mounting debt service cash needs at DWR. Regards, Michael ",

Mark - please let me know once we have spoken to the five senior managers in your group as we do not want to send this out until either you, Michael or I have spoken to them about this structure. Draft After nearly five years in London, Mark Schroeder will be returning to the US on April 11th to join the North American Coal Business with responsibility for origination in the utility sector. Under Mark's leadership, his team has made significant contributions towards Enron Europe's =01&first mover=018 advantage and its status as the leading new entrant in the liberalizing pan=01)European energy markets. We wish him well in his new commercial role. With Mark's departure, the day-to-day management of the Government & Regulatory Affairs Department in Europe will rest with Peter Styles, Paul Dawson, Paul Hennemeyer, and Doug Wood. Nick O'Day will continue in his current leadership capacity in Japan. Each of these five individuals and their groups will now jointly report to the business heads and to Rick Shapiro, in the Government Affairs team in Houston. Rick Shapiro will continue to manage Government Affairs for the Americas. While the team members responsibilities will vary from time-to-time in response to shifting commercial priorities, as well as the need to support other Enron Wholesale Services' business units from time-to-time, the general areas of responsibility will be as follows: Peter Styles, based in Brussels, will continue to have responsibilty for our EU and Netherlands advocacy. Paul Hennemeyer will lead efforts in the German speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) as well as France and Belgium. Peter and Paul will report to Eric Shaw. While secunded to the commercial team in France, Philip Davies will address Nordic market issues on an ad hoc basis and also report to Paul on these issues. Paul Dawson will lead our UK, Spain and Italian power regulatory efforts as well as the gas regulatory work in the UK. Doug Wood will support the Continental Gas team and the Central and Southeastern Europe Origination efforts, while also addressing the UK Climate Change Levy. Doug's role in gas will continue to be to supplement, and not to supplant, the efforts of each of the team members' geographic responsibilities noted on the organisation chart. Paul and Doug will report to Richard Lewis locally. Nick O'Day will also continue to report to Joe Hirl in Japan. Other regulatory support provided by Mark Schroder will be addressed in another organizational announcement that will be sent out from Governmental Affairs in Houston. Attached is the revised organization chart that now reflects the Governmental & Regulatory Affairs organization in Enron Europe. John Sherriff & Michael Brown ",

Schedule to Master Agreement 1. Media General wants the cross-default to be reciprocal at $100 million for both Media General and Enron. 2. Further, Media General thinks that this should be a cross-acceleration, not a cross-default. 3. Page 3 of Schedule. The \"date by which to be delivered\" for Party B should track the same with Party A: i.e., if financials are available on EDGAR then they would not be automatically provided by MG on a quarterly basis. 4. Page 4 of Schedule. Under (a), add \"Attn.: Chief Financial Officer\". We will send Marshall Morton's fax and telephone numbers. 5. We will let you know who will serve as process agent. We would like to talk about governing law in Texas and the site of arbitration in Houston. 6. Page 6 of Schedule. In clause(b)(g), please note that MG intends to assign this agreement and we want to make sure that does not affect this representation. 7.Page 8 of Schedule. MG wants the right to assign this agreement to a party with a credit agreement equivalent to a certain level. We can discuss what that level should be. We should discuss what Enron's credit rating is in this connection. Transaction Confirmation Document. 1. MG does not think this transaction should be characterized as a \"swaption\". This was to be a deal for the purchase of newsprint at a fixed price, not at Enron's option. 2. We want todiscuss the expiration date. We should also discuss the other dates and terms which are blank. On page 2, under \"Additional Provisions\", the date for satisfying conditions is clearly wrong since it refers to July 5. Once again, all of this ties in with not being an option, but a fixed agreement. 3. We would like to have Enron render a monthly settlement statement with a net amount being paidto/receivable from MG. No netting is presently provided for in the agreement. ISDA Credit Support Annex MG would like to delete this entirely and would propose that Enron would rely on the general cross-acceleration provisions. Media General never contemplated credit provisions more onerous than its credit agreements. I will have the Media General business people follow up with the people at Enron, but could you please have some one get in touch with me on this. Thanks, John ",

You have a good hand on the legal issues for the employment matters. If a form of indemnity is required, make it very broad to cover all risks, including, but not limited to, selection, unlawful discrimination and for permitting tortuous interference with employment. I assume that you have received my November 1 memo regarding Bidder D. Redlined SPA. I listened in on the labor relations call yesterday, but there didn't seem to be anything for me to comment on. I do have one observation about the call. While I don't know anything about the transaction, the conversation about employment and benefits would have been facilitated if Enron had previously submitted a written schedule of all of the documents and information Enron required in completing its due diligence review, and used that written schedule to make reference to the data that has not yet been received. Enron should not let the other side's data schedule or lack of a complete schedule control Enron's due diligence agenda. Enron should know in advance what information it wants and use a check off sheet to manage the due diligence process. That way, the other side will better understand what Enron expectations are. I use this kind of data management tool all of the time and it is very helpful to be able to refer to when it was presented to the other side, how long they have had it and what items are still missing. I heard nothing like that in the conference call yesterday. It was though people were thinking of things as the conversation went along. Pat ",

First, as a part of our new initiative in Enron Net Works, it is becoming clear that we have the opportunity to quickly expand Enron's underlying business model to other commodity markets. Such an expansion requires a coordinated focus on strategy as we select and develop these opportunities. Second, the success of EnronOnline and the continued expansion of our wholesale activities in North America and Europe have increased the coordination requirements across our North American and European operations. As a result of these two factors, we are making the following organizational changes effective immediately: Cliff Baxter will move from Enron North America to Enron Corp. as Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. Mark Frevert will become Chairman and CEO of North America, replacing Cliff. In addition, Mark will remain Chairman of Enron Europe. John Sherriff will become President and CEO of Enron Europe. We are confident that these changes will increase the effectiveness of our organization. Please join us in congratulating Cliff, Mark and John on their new responsibilities. ",

The major changes in the compliance filing were removal of approval rights, such as 1) acquisition or encumbrance of a transmission asset and 2) sale or issuance of membership interests. Craig Baker indicated he would send a copy of the compliance filing tomorrow. He also indicated that they planned to file by late today or tomorrow. Agenda for the 29th -- The agenda seems to be in place; however, they did indicate that they would only be able to address the wires to wires synergy discussion in part. They indicated that they would be able to address the areas where savings or additional revenue would be generated but may not be in a position to specify the financial impact (i.e., ebitda and market value impact). They also indicated that Andersen has all of the individual Company numbers but not sure when the consolidated top financials will be available. Craig Baker committed to provide an update by tomorrow morning. I have a call into Larry Oliva from Andersen as well. Native Load -- The difference between our respective positions (per Craig Baker) supports my earlier description. Craig indicated that the Native Load and Wholesale Network Customers are advantaged (as compared to the Firm Point-to-Point Wholesale Customer) as a result of the filed Network Agreement. This allows the Network Customers to increase capacity as load grows (potentially usurping the rollover right of a Firm Point-to-Point Wholesale Customer). The Alliance feels this will be a point of contention between the State PUC's and FERC, and, they did not want to be placed in the middle. Participation and Valuation -- AEP -- Craig Baker indicated that Henry Fayne will be there 1st -- Stan Szwed indicated he is confirming their CFO's attendance. He will get back with me by Monday. Detroit Edison -- Joe Welch is confirming the attendance of their lead M&A representative and will get back with me by Monday (He also applauds our attempts to move this forward) Consumers -- Chuck Waits is discussing the resource issue with Chris Helms (President and COO) .

We agreed on an aggressive schedule with power flowing by 2/1/01. The process is set up for DWR, working with a consultant. It's an RFP rather than an auction process. The idea of a mock auction was rejected. -- Product definition -- Much work needed here. Major issue set forth below. -- Contract -- Most parties (including Enron) want to use the EEI standard contract. Group working on additional provisions. Plan final contract by Friday. Utility Debt -- Attended by Sarah Novosel -- Report later Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts NEW MAJOR ISSUE: Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they want the State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that this had been their idea all along. In their view, the utilities provide a forecast and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of the utilities. They were unwilling to commit to any time frame. Kind of Auction or RFP -- a.k.a What does the Governor really want? Many people in the room believe that the Governor was firm in his demand for 5.5 cent power for ALL the unmet load of the utilities. We spent four hours debating these issues. In the end, the parties felt that the best approach would be to have simulataneous auctions as follows: -- Separate bids for NP 15 and SP 15 -- RFP 1 -- Suppliers submit bids for more than one product with a blended price of 5.5 cents. -- RFP 2 -- (Considered closest to the Gov's proposal) State sets price of 5.5 cents and suppliers compete on term and volume. --RFP3 -- Suppliers provide bids for any of the utilities' product needs and are free to bid any price, volume or term. -- All RFPs would be conducted simultaneously. Parties agree that RFP3 is most likely to get the greatest number of bids. Next Steps Meetings continue on Thursday Plan is to have final documents ready for the next meeting of the principals Principals tentatively set to meet on Friday or Saturday.",

We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged. Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval. With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price. We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval. We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review. Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

        "clean_content": "Meeting with Ft. James On Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft. James. I informed him Enron wanted the original $10mm back. It was our belief that FJ did not act in good faith in \"expeditiously and fairly evaluating\" all of Enron's energy proposals. Phil argued that Enron saw substantial revenue from the commodity (gas & coal) deals that were executed. I argued that commodity deals were never the \"intent\" of the Alliance as outlined in the \"Objectives of the Parties.\" I told him we didn't need an Alliance agreement to do commodity deals. Phil was only prepared to argue the definition of \"substantial assets\" as it related to the asset sale. I told him Kalamazoo was substantial to us because that was where we had a significant energy project. It was also substantial because the mill was ranked in the top 3 in terms of natural gas consumption. FJ let us work on the Kzoo project for 9 months before informing us the mill would be sold. I told Phil this is not how Alliance partners treat each other. I asked Phil if he was prepared to offer any proposal to resolve the situation. His response was FJ was happy with the Alliance and wanted to continue with it \"as is.\" My response was that was not acceptable to Enron. I told him the list of potential mediators for the dispute was being sent to their counsel Greg Chaffee. Next Steps: I think we need to pick out a couple of strong project examples to use in our case to present to the mediator. Rather than just show the list of potential deals Enron pitched and the lost opportunity value, I think a stronger case to get our original $10mm back is to say here are 3 examples, here is the value to both parties, and FJ still did not do the project (or they chose to do it themselves). This should go a long way to proving \"bad faith\". I will get with David Barr and start assembling this information along with the entire project list and the various \"reasons\" FJ chose not to do the projects. Based on this initial meeting, if the parties can't resolve the dispute within 30 days, the dispute goes to non-binding mediation. The parties are to meet with the mediator within 21 days of the dispute being referred to the mediator. Per the Alliance agreement, the mediation meeting should take place anytime between now and November 10. Let me know if you have questions. ",

        "clean_content": "Show Cause Motion I spoke with Paul on Friday regarding his meeting with Adam Wenner and Doug Nickles to discuss Portland General's concerns about the Show Cause Motion. While Doug was unsure of whether an RTO commitment would be necessary in a future sale of Portland General, Adam Wenner assured Doug that FERC would definately require Portland to make an RTO commitment. In the last attempted merger with Sierra, Portland made a commitment to join an RTO, provided that BPA was also part of that RTO. PGE explained that because its system is so intertwined with BPA, that it realistically could not join an RTO without BPA. FERC found this commitment, with the BPA qualification, to be acceptable. While PGE would probably be willing to make the same RTO commitment that it made last time, the Show Cause Motion goes farther than that. We say in the Show Cause Motion that every entity must make an unqualified commitment to join a FERC approved RTO. It does not provide for exceptions. A couple of things came out of Paul's meeting with Doug. First, Doug asks that we delay filing the Motion for a couple of weeks, to see if anything happens regarding a new sale of PGE. Doug is concerned that if we make a commitment before an agreement is reached, that the existence of the commitment could delay entering into a final sales agreement. Second, we need to decide how to deal with the PGE commitment. It is unlikely that PGE will be willing to commit to RTO participation without BPA. Paul and I discussed that perhaps we could reference in the Show Cause Motion the Federal Power Marketing Agencies and the need for them to join in the RTOs in order for the utilities to make an RTO commitment - perhaps reference Pacific Northwest particularly, although this looks a little transparent. The problem is that many entities will try and use this as an excuse to not join an RTO. Also, Paul and I discussed the \"One Western RTO\" issue and how Enron responds to that. We talked about three possibilities: 1) try to not take a position on the One Western RTO issue -- push for RTO development in the west but try and stay out of the one-versus-two-versus-three RTOs in the West; 2) take a position saying that the west is different, the California mess continues, people are concerned that California will contaminate the rest of the west, so we should create an RTO in the rest of the West and have California join when it gets in line with FERC; 3) support FERC's statements that it wants one RTO in the west and push for this (although most of our people tell us that this will lead to inaction on any western RTO development); or 4) focus on the east and forget about the west. The second option causes me concern because I think that, if we take this position in the West, even though the West is different, our position will be used against us in the East. For example, some people oppose one Northeast RTO because they are concerned that New York (a disfunctional market) will contaminate PJM (a working market). It's a slippery slope for us to try and distinguish the west from the east. If we make contrary arguments in the west, they will be used against us in the east. Your thoughts are appreciated.

A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this transaction.

We have reviewed the draft of the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sales Agreement and find it generally to be a good agreement. The attached file contains an addendum with three changes that we would like to make to the contract. The first item is merely a grammatical clarification. The second relates to the fact that we typically do not get the annual report out within 120 days. This year, we got it out in about 180 days. The third item relates to a requirement that we must follow as a municipal corporation. Although the purchase process has not yet been approved by executive management, we wanted to get the contractual issues resolved so that the agreement could be immediately put in place once the approval occurs. Please do not hesitate to contact me at (210)353-3725 if you have an questions about the addendum. <<Enfolio Addendum.doc>> Thank you, Christian W.

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry. Thank you.

        "clean_content": "Northeast RTO Mediation Report Yesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session. Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs. This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO. The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is \"subject to extension\" if new design requirements are introduced. We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures. A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached. One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance. We too believe this is necessary. It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance. We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible. Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market. We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear. Background The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a \"business plan\" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created. Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission. The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly. Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues: market design and governance. Market Design At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO. This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years (\"Option 1-M\"of the Business Plan). This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below). The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years (\"Option 2-M\" of the Business Plan). PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 (\"Option 3-M\" of the Business Plan). We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003. Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable. As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining \"Best Practices.\" Although PJM also conducted a \"best practices\" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are \"best practices.\" The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) \"far outstrips\" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support. However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM. The Judge states that \"impatience, haste and greed\" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process \"at the expense of sound policy\" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to \"exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint.\" See Report, page 18. Governance The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance: interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process. The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option. Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach. The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures. PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO. PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs: 5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England. The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins). NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board. One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO. The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders. We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system. Post Mediation The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge. The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment. We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition. We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared. Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal. Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal. Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report. Sarah, Dan, Howard and Tom ",

In addition, the ISO discussed the reference to an affidavit in the subpoena with the CPUC and was informed that this results from a typo which will be corrected in a corrected document sent by federal express to the ISO yesterday (the words attached affidavit will be replaced with the word attachments). The ISO has accepted federal express service of the subpoena. The ISO has raised confidentiality concerns with the CPUC and the CPUC agreed to circulate a draft of a confidentiality agreement to the ISO today. The ISO will forward the draft to market participants and scheduling coordinators as soon as we receive it. Once again the ISO reiterates to market participants that to the extent they have outstanding issues as to the subpoena, these should be raised directly with the appropriate entity. The ISO intends to comply with the subpoena on Friday unless it receives a legally sufficient communication to the contrary from the CPUC or a court. Finally, a few market participants have requested that the ISO make available several letters forwarded to the EOB discussing confidential treatment. These letters are attached. Questions should be directed to Jeanne M. Sol, at 916-608-7144. Jeanne M.

        "clean_content": " gnemec.nsf Confidential Work Material - Attorney Client Privilege Attached for review is a draft of the letter to be sent to Wildhorse concerning the Gathering Agreement under which the Entrada and Dakota production is committed. Please review and provide comments. To summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement: 1. Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday. Brett also forwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse. The correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings conducted between Enogex and Wildhorse. No demands were made by Enogex and no claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse. Brett stated that the Entrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications. Enogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or Questar. I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release the gas. He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo negotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse. 2. I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa. Nothing really useful. There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area called Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought these assets were in a state of economic viability decline. Unfortunately this letter was not directed to Enogex. However, the draft letter takes that position with Wildhorse. 3. I am securing local consul out of Denver. I want someone intimately familiar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective to be involved. We may need to seek a declaratory order. We have run into to conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown. Should have this resolved on Monday. 4. Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the declaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse. This draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas. However, to reiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right to deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement. The fact that the Entrada Gas is not in spec. with the downstream pipelines for inerts, allows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in default. ",

Lindsey, et al: Attached is PG&E's revised OFO Settlement Agreement based on our discussion and agreements at yesterday's Settlement Conference. Before getting into the details, I want to thank Lindsey and the other active parties for their diligence and willingness to negotiate constructively in order to reach consensus. The following highlights the changes, which are shown as revision-marks against our September 24 proposal. We've added a couple of \"clean-up\" changes not specifically addressed yesterday. I don't believe these should cause any problem. * \"Significantly\" is added under A. and B.1. * In section B.1, we have inserted the term \"Gas OFO Forum\" so when we talk about this forum outside the settlement, it has a specific name we all recognize and agree to. We have made changes elsewhere in the document to include this more formal title. We also included \"or customer\" as being able to join the Forum. * In B.2, we used the words provided yesterday by the parties with two exceptions: * First, the language was revised to make a six-month comparison of OFO reductions, rather than a quarterly comparison as we agreed, and * Second, we added the word \"other\" to modify \"members\" in two places so it is clear that PG&E is also a member of the Forum. * In B.3, we changed the term \"Settlement Parties\" to \"Gas OFO Forum\" to reflect the intent of the agreement. * In B.4, we added the sentence at the end as requested, but, per our discussion, did not remove our last sentence. We added more specific language on the balancing account to be clearer, and noted that this issue is not fully resolved pending feedback from a couple parties. * In C.1.g, we used the language provided, removing the one sentence as agreed, and we added a comma and an \"a\" in the last sentence. * We did not include the proposed change from the parties for C.1.f.(3) for more data, since per yesterday's discussion we already agreed to provide that data elsewhere. * In C.3.b.(7), we modified the language to reflect our discussion that we would use a 100% Performance Factor for the first customer-specific OFO, and then an average of the actual performance for subsequent customer-specific OFOs, but not less than 50%. We also agree to post the performance data and revised factor within 14 days of each customer-specific OFO, and if another customer-specific OFO is needed in that period, to use the prior factor. We also changed \"Settlement Parties\" to the \"Gas OFO Forum.\" Lastly, we changed the \"next session\" to \"an ongoing basis\" which better fits the continuous nature of the data and adjustments. * In C.4.a, although not discussed the group at the Settlement Conference, Ron Oechsler, on behalf of Palo Alto, pointed out that our description of the three days when cashouts were driven by market economics was not quite correct. We have reviewed his comment and concur, and have corrected the wording accordingly. This does not change this provision to modify the cash-out prices. * In C.5.e.(4), we added the monthly election option. * In D.3.c, we added the suggested language, but changed \"Settlement Parties\" to the \"Gas OFO Forum.\" * On Appendix A, Revised Tariffs, we added the new balancing account which would be part of the Preliminary Statement in PG&E's gas tariffs. We will send you a draft of this tariff sheet with the full package next week. With the one loose end regarding the balancing account language, we believe that this document reflects our agreement with the parties. We will follow up with the motion, tariffs, and final settlement agreement after confirming with Lindsey that we have captured yesterday's discussion accurately. Again, thanks for all your active participation and support for getting this Settlement completed.

I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J. She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions. Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date. Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said. I see two options: 1. If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is: I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today. If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today. Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started. 2. If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is. Caveat: I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly. Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys. I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running. If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know. I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do. Britt ",

I think that is all I changed. I also added a quick intro. and a paragraph on future payments to reiterate this is only for October purchases. Neither may be necessary, let me know. I am not sure your availability tomorrow, but I would love to hear from you ASAP in the morning to get this in front of Peoples for signature.

George Wasaff, managing director, will report directly to Rick Causey, executive vice president and chief accounting officer for Enron. GSS, formed February 1, 2000, will continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for Enron.

London's pay cycles are different than ours however, and they only get paid on the 20th of each month. Tony did not receive a paycheck on March 20th because all of his new hire information has to be put into SAP (the payroll system) by the first of the month for the employee to receive a check on the 20th. Consequently, Tony will not receive his first paycheck until April 20th. If you would like for me to try and work with the London office however and try to get him a paycheck quicker than that, please let me know. 2) Joe Carson From what I am able to gather, Gary Hickerson did make Joe Carson an offer that consisted of a one-year contract. However, Gary is out of town until Monday, and no one is sure of the specifics of the deal. Would you like me to contace Joe to find out the specifics, or would it be more acceptable for me to wait until Gary returns so that I can get all of the facts. I look forward to working with you.

We now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer. There were a rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Attached is a memo we handed out to employees, but basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities. The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago. In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market. 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL, we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages. We anticipate closing the EOGIL transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001. 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001. 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale process c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms. We told them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a PSA with a buyer. However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers or through redeployment within Enron. Those people that do not remain with the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide transition services to a buyer. I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible. Last year when we were for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know. If anyone in the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week. Mike Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878). He is fully briefed on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL. Mike will be traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday. I will be available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713. I would suggest talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible. This afternoon I notified our partners and thr Gov't of India of our intention to market our assets. I will be making a trip to India soon to visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two weeks. While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me. As you might expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these groups. I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above. If you have any questions, contact me at the above numbers. jeff ",

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry. Thank you.

On July 1, 1999 through October 31, 1999 Cabot began purchasing supply from Enron at Sumas. When we received the Transaction Agreement dated June 10, 1999, I began calling regarding the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated November 1, 1993, stated therein. I could find no such agreement in our files. On July 28, 1999, Karen Lambert faxed this Agreement. I then realized that Enron was utilizing an Agreement which had not been assigned to Cabot in its merger with Washington Energy Resources Company in May 1994. I tried on several occasions to explain the situation. Finally on October 24, 2000 we received the above referenced Agreement originally effective October 1, 2000. We then requested the effective date to be July 1, 1999 to encompass the original transaction along with the three (3) additional transactions. See the attached sheet for specific deal information. <<GC115.xls>> Hope this helps. I have submitted the master agreement for execution and will let you know when it is on its way. Thanks.

As a part of the merger-related activity, Engage (which is a limited partnership) is being split as between its two owners, Westcoast and Coastal. Virtually all of my clients (the \"big deal\" Structured Power Group here at Engage) are moving with a subsidiary of our other owner, Westcoast, while I am remaiining here in Houston with Engage, which is a Coastal subsidiary.? So, despite the fact that power is a growth area, my propsects vis a vis the merger are less good than if I were still supporting a substantial client base.? So, I am now looking at other opportunities that may be available, despite the fact I have been with Engage only a year. Attached you will find a cover letter and my resume.?

Please see Section 6 in particular. Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and Texas law will apply. We could move that to New York, with New York law if that is better for Henwood. If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K. law, with arb in Singapore. but any other law, including Australian law, would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please). I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwood's proposal, and believe I succeeded. Our form has some additional terms not contained in their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the \"Business Conduct\" and \"Drug Policy\" language). Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement. Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost plus 15%--so you might not want to do it. Please let me know if you have any comments or questions. Bonnie ",

After working with the detailed April 26th letter and seeing that it was quite complex for the current stage of discussions, I decided to look into Kays' Blue Dog data base. There I found a letter dated March 26 (also referred to in the final April 26th Letter Agreement as the Initial Letter Agreement). This letter I believe was the LOI originally sent out to outline thedeal and ultimately led to the April 26th Definitive Agreement. A copy is attached below for your review. If this is the concept of the type of proposal you want to send out in conjunction with the NEPCO proposal which wecould incentivize by the pricing concept that you referred to in your noteto Ben this evening, then please review this version in the morning ratherthan the April 26th letter. If it is consistent in concept, format and approach then I will use this letter as the basis to detail your project dealand include the input I expect to receive tomorrow from Rose Engeldorf on the financial structuring of the parties for whom ENA would be acting as agent to sale the turbines. Let me know if you agree with this approach. I believe it will facilitate finalizing a draft that everyone would be happy with by Thursday. From a practical concept ENA and Nepco, like we discussed, would should submit separate but cross referenced proposal letters concurrently (ENA for the turbine sale and Nepco for the EPC proposal minus the turbines. The incentivized pricing mechanism mentioned in your note to Ben thus could be addressed via a cross reference in the respective letters should that be thecommercial decision made.

Kay - word is you worked the Northwestern deal. Ron wants to borrow from the Northwestern deal as this sale wil need to be done as a sale of the entity, not just the contract. Apparently, there is more of a customs issue involved here than a consent issue, but some of the mechanics will be similar. Could you talk to Randy about the Northwestern sale and get him connectedup with the dox? thanks. -----Original Message----- From: Tapscott, Ron Sent:Tuesday, November 13, 2001 2:41 PM To:Schwartzenburg, John Subject:FW: Letter Agreement this is the letter agreement for the sale of the mhi equipment at port of export. the letter agreement below is for the northwestern deal which embodies the sale of interest in company as part of the structure. thanks, ron. -----Original Message----- From: Booth, Chris Sent:Tuesday, November 13, 2001 1:27 PM To:Tapscott, Ron Subject:Letter Agreement ",

        "clean_content": " RGAY (Non-Privileged).pst This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals. The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done. These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is \"significant potential for undue discrimination\" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative. Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny. FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the \"linchpin\" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates. During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was \"important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side,\" that \"all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines.\" Last week's proclamation should be considered \"a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend,\" he asserted. In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties \"are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk\" of such unequal treatment. FERC declared that a \"key factor\" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an \"appropriate material deviation\" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide \"adequate alternatives\" to other shippers. In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs. The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, \"we have reconsidered that holding\" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order. Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an \"adequate alternative,\" the commission observed. \"However, if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not include any such provision.\" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk, giving it \"an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,\" the commission pointed out. \"A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,\" FERC said, adding that \"such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.\" Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights \"is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated\" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language \"will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.\" Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become \"muddled.\" Through a \"tortured line of cases,\" FERC's definitions of allowable contracting practices were \"obscured,\" Breathitt said in welcoming the new \"common-sense\" approach. The \"tug of war\" that parties have engaged in over the past few years \"really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service\" are available to all shippers, she said.",

        "clean_content": " steven merriss 6-28-02.nsf This Information Applies ONLY to Organizations Supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable Processing Centers Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement and payment tool, iBuyit eProcurement, is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central. But there is still more to come! On May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers. The new iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of receipt and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issue resolution. In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the way you currently order and pay for goods and services. Following these changes will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit Payables system. Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when placing an order and instruct them to reference this information: * Company Number or Legal Entity Name * Contact Name * Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order Number * New P.O. Box (See Below) What is an EID? An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back to the purchaser electronically through iBuyit. Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders? Yes. When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID. It is your responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for non-purchase orders. Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders? No. When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do. What if I do not know my EID? All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number. You can access your EID number in eHRonline. Logon to eHRonline, choose =01&Personal Information=018 to pull up your personal profile. On the leftside of the =01&Personal Information=018 screen select =01&Other=018 and you will see your: * PID (SAP ID) * GIS ID * EID What is our new mailing address (PO Box)? Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the following address: PO Box 4734 Houston, TX 77210-4734 What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me? HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope =01&Attention Enron Accounts Payable,=018 and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enronmail center. FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable department in Houston. Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following physical address: 3724 Dacoma Houston, TX 77092 ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE Note: ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order invoices locally. How will vendors learn about these changes? This information will be shared directly with vendors in a separate communication. Questions? Send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>",

        "clean_content": "Intercompany Billings Follow-Up Importance: High Corporate Charges Tracy Geaccone has suggested (and discussed with Terry West in Corporate Planning) that the pipelines be allowed access to the 2002 Plan once it has been loaded in SAP for the Corporate cost centers that bill us. The Plan would be recorded by GL account within each of the applicable cost centers. Corporate prepares a schedule that shows which cost centers bill us, the methodologies used and the amounts billed. It would be quite an undertaking because of the number of Corporate cost centers involved, but each of the pipelines would be able to derive a FERC breakdown using the Plan, plus the schedule from Corporate. The main issue would be manpower. Tracy mentioned the possibility of having one of the associate analysts perform this task, but said that the Plan would not be finalized and loaded until probably the end of November. Is this an acceptable solution? Do we need a meeting to discuss this further? I am still waiting for return phone calls from Enron Networks and Global Finance. There are just a few Global Finance cost centers that bill us. However, the method proposed above may also be a solution for Enron Networks billings. Enron Property and Services Corp. The mandate that these billings be recorded in individual cost centers rather than at a company level originated with Tracy Geaccone with a promise of cost savings to Stan. However, Tracy told me that rather than coding to a cost center, she has requested that the coding be to a FAR order. I told her that would mean multiple FAR orders. Her thinking is that each cost center already has a FAR order. I attempted to describe our use of custom variants. She said that she would work through Bob Chandler. If we intend to continue using the custom variants, it would mean creating a large number of new FAR orders. Again, is this an acceptable solution? Do we need a meeting to discuss this further? ",

Regarding the transformer, the contract counterparty is \"ABB Power T & D Company\" 2. The purchase price of the transformer ($786,000) was taken from the WLB financing book and does not include any of the capitalized interest charges or option payment (total $56,803) allocation that Global Finance has included in the calculation of the Payoff #. The full cost of the transformer would be $842,803. 3. The purchase price of each turbine ($14,072,000) was calculated as an average cost based upon a spreadsheet provided by GE. This price does not include the $280,000 in change order costs allocated to each machine. The full cost of each turbine should be $14,352,000. The $280K in change order was picked up in the original payoff # prepared by Global Finance. Ben has not yet reviewed any of the values in 2 or 3 above or the current payoff # determined by Global Finance. I will talk with him first thing in the morning.

You may notice some changes in the way information is reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below. What's Different? ? Your =01+home' cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay advice. This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial modules of SAP. ? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P' represent earning types reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time for the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice as =01+PVacation'. ? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions will remain itemized in the deduction section. ? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-date totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your pay advice throughout the year. (Note that your W2 at the end of the year will reflect your earnings by company). ? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the related dollar amount will be included in the =01+Salary' earnings type. ? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555 Payroll FAQ's My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stand for? There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck. For some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to print. In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions and prints them on one line =01) titled =01&other deductions=018. The detail of all deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet at eHRonline.enron.com. What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean? These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll from the side index. Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck? Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected in the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice as =01+POvertime'. What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)? For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit is applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amount withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FICA will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return. What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock options? There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form requesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , select Enron Payroll from the side index).",

        "clean_content": "Enron/Peoples -- loan documents Kay, I will be preparing the loan documents for the joint venture with Peoples. I understand that the loans will be unsecured but cross guarantied (i.e., Enron will guaranty the People's loans and vice versa), but I have several additional, basic questions re: the terms of the Enron loan and the intercreditor arrangements with Peoples. In terms of beginning drafting the loan documents, answers to questions 6(a) and 8 would be extremely helpful in selecting an appropriate form. 1. People's loan agreement -- will it be an exact clone of ours? 2. Guaranties -- will the cross-guaranties guaranty payment to the other venturer of all unpaid amounts under such venturer's loan agreement, or will they instead function more as an intercreditor/sharing agreement (i.e., if one venturer receives a payment that the other does not, the paid venturer will share its payment ratably with the unpaid venturer)? 3. Intercreditor Issues/Exercise of remedies -- Please confirm that there is to be no 100% lender vote requirement for acceleration, etc., and that each venturer can pursue remedies with respect to its loan independently (although I presume the facilities will be cross defaulted). 4. Advancing mechanics -- besides requiring ratable advances with the People's facility, will there be any conditions precedent to advances other than the typical no default/representations true & correct/no MAC? 5. Repayment -- will there be any commitment step-downs/mandatory prepayments? 6. Interest -- what will the (a) interest rate basis and (b) margin be? 7. Fees -- Will there be any sort of upfront fee? What will the commitment fee be? (And what will the amount of Enron's commitment be?) 8. Lender(s) -- Does Enron intend to keep its revolver as a single lender facility, or should we provide for a syndicated arrangement? 9. Other information -- When will specific financial covenant information be available? Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing. I look forward to working with you on this transaction.

In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed \"Petitions for Rehearing.\" ? The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions. ? Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial. ? In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects. ? Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds. ? Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds. ? The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01. The precise language is cited below. ? If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo. Best, Jeff \"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.

Beck Thomas E. Ganucheau BECK, REDDEN & SECREST, L.L.P. 1221 McKinney, Suite 4500 Houston, Texas 77010-2010 Laura Gibson ANSWERS TO INTERROGATORIES INTERROGATORY NO. 1: Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention that CPSC =01&breached the Assignment Agreement=018 by allegedly =01&failing to endeavor in good faith to obtain the consent from LCRA.=018 ANSWER: On July 30, 1999, Calpine entered into an agreement with Enron in which it agreed to assume Enron's obligation to supply power to the LCRA under the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 31, 1995 and as it was amended on April 15, 1999. The July 30, 1999 Assignment Agreement contains a condition that Calpine will obtain LCRA's written consent to the assignment and a release of Enron and its affiliates from any and all obligations and liabilities under the Agreement. Calpine specifically agreed to endeavor in good faith to obtain LCRA's consent as soon as practicable following Enron's execution of the Assignment Agreement. Shortly after the execution of the Assignment Agreement, Ed Baughman and Steve Snow spoke to determine the status of Calpine's efforts to obtain LCRA 's consent. Mr. Baughman followed up with Mr. Snow during the week of August 16, 1999 to determine the status of Calpine's efforts to obtain LCRA' s consent. It was clear from Mr. Baughman's conversation with Mr. Snow that Calpine was not exercising its best efforts to obtain LCRA's consent. When this became apparent, Mr. Baughman and others at Enron began making inquiries of LCRA to determine what would be required to obtain LCRA's consent. These conversations made it clear that Calpine had not explored the issue with the LCRA. Further, Enron representatives were advised by representatives of the LCRA that Calpine had not furnished any financial information to the LCRA to make it comfortable with Calpine's assumptionof the delivery obligations. Such failure by Calpine to use due diligence in obtaining LCRA's consent combined with its failure to provide the LCRA with any financial or credit information demonstrates that Calpine did not endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA's consent. INTERROGATORY NO. 2: Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention that CPSC failed =01&to exercise good faith in agreeing to reasonable requests relating to the assignment,=018 specifically identifying each and every alleged =01&reasonable request=018, and when, how, by whom, and under what circumstances the request was made, and CPSC's response to each request. ANSWER: Calpine failed to exercise good faith in agreeing to reasonable requests relating to the assignment by failing to endeavor in good faith to obtain LCRA's consent to the assignment, failing to provide LCRA with financial information and failing to provide LCRA with a parent guaranty guaranteeing Calpine Power Services Corporation's performance of its assumption of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement. Additionally, Calpine failed to agree to reasonable requests when it failed to provide an indemnification from its parent corporation indemnifying Enron in the event that Enron paid any money out on its guaranty to the LCRA. On or about August 26, 1999, after it became clear that Calpine was not taking any effort to endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA's consent, David Portz of Enron sent Ron Fischer of Calpine the documents necessary to provide Calpine's parent guaranty and indemnification of any payment by Enron under the LCRA agreement. Calpine refused to execute these documents or to negotiate in good faith for any necessary modifications thereto. Additionally, in a telephone conversation between Enron and Calpine representatives, Calpine conceded that in the past, it had traditionally provided a parent guaranty. INTERROGATORY NO. 3: Please describe in detail any and all damages allegedly suffered by you and for which you seek redress herein, and describe in detail the method by which such damages are calculated. ANSWER: Enron has not yet calculated the damages it has incurred as a result of Calpine's breach of its obligations under the Assignment Agreement. Enron continues to have an obligation to supply the LCRA with power and will be required to do so until the contract terminates on December 31, 2002. Enron will supplement this interrogatory in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. INTERROGATORY NO. 4: Do you contend that CPSC was obligated under the July 30, 1999 Letter to seek and/or secure a guarantee from Calpine Corporation? If you answer to either is =01&yes,=018 please describe in detail the legal and factual basis for each such contention. ANSWER: Yes. Beginning during approximately the summer of 1998, it became customary in the wholesale power market to provide a parent guarantee when the power was either being purchased by or sold to a marketing affiliate. In a telephone conference on the afternoon of August 27, 1999, Calpine representatives conceded that they generally provided a parent guaranty. Additionally, the representatives conceded that it did not cost Calpine Power Services Company any money to provide a parent guaranty. In the negotiations between Enron and Calpine prior to the execution of the Assignment Agreement, it was understood that Calpine would provide a parent guarantee. When the transaction changed from the back-to-back transaction to the assignment, in recognition of the increased risk, Enron increased the amount that it was willing to pay Calpine to assume its obligations under the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement to $1.8 million. In recognition that parent guarantees are customary in the industry, in December of 1999, Calpine and Enron exchanged parent guarantees. INTERROGATORY NO. 5: Identify each action which you contend is =01&customary and reasonable in the industry=018 and which you contend CPSC failed to undertake in order to =01&obtain LCRA's consent=018 to the assignment of the Power Agreement. ANSWER: Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable manner by failing to act promptly to obtain the LCRA's consent to Calpine's assignment. Further, Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable manner in failing to provide LCRA with any financial information concerning Calpine Power Services Corporation or its parent in order to assure the LCRA of Calpine's financial ability to perform under the Assignment Agreement. Calpine also failed to provide either Enron or LCRA with a parent guarantee and to provide parent indemnification to Enron for any amounts paid by Enron to the LCRA as a result of Calpine's failure to perform its obligations under the Power Purchase and Sale Agreement. INTERROGATORY NO. 6: Identify and describe in detail each and ever action taken by you to mitigate your alleged damages in this matter. ANSWER: On December 8, 1999, Enron gave notice to the LCRA of its termination of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 31, 1995, as amended on April 15, 1999 effective December 31, 2002. On December 31, 1999, Enron entered into an agreement with Oxy Vinyls, L.P. wherein Enron Power Marketing, Inc. purchased electrical capacity and energy from Oxy. Additionally, Enron has purchased the power necessary to supply the LCRA at the lowest prices available to it in the market.

Eric will add to this outline and forward his comments to Kay Mann so she can begin to draft the agreement. Our plan is to present this document to PERC by Friday - assuming we can get it drafted and reviewed internally by that time. This agreement constitutes a binding agreement - under the terms and conditions stated below - for Enron Canada Corporation (\"ECC\") to acquire a set of ABB/Alstom Power (\"ABB\") 11N2 single burner combustion turbines (\"Units\") from Peoples Energy Resources Corporation (\"PERC\"). The obligation by ECC to acquire the Units shall be conditioned upon those items as further described below being met (\"Conditions Precedent\") by not later than September 1, 2000. ECC will acquire the Units through assignment of that certain Turbine Purchase Agreement (\"Contract\") between ABB and PERC dated __________, as renegotiated in accordance with the Conditions Precedent below, which shall include good faith negotiations between ECC/PERC and ABB in order to reform the Contract terms to better accomodate the use of the Units by ECC. PERC and ECC hereby agree that ECC shall be authorized by PERC to negotiate directly with ABB in order to attempt to secure the Contract amendments described in the Conditions Precedent, and PERC will indemnify ECC from any adverse claims or causes of action against ECC as a result of those negotiations except and unless they are a result of gross negligence or willfull misconduct on the part of ECC. Further, prior to ECC entering into said negotiations with ABB, PERC shall secure written acceptance of ABB's agreement to negotiate directly with ECC and ABB's acknowledgement that they waive their rights to any recourse to ECC in relation to said negotiations. Price: The price for the Units - and all associated ancilliary equipment being provided under the Contract - is $56 million (US - a joke for your benefit Eric). Term: This agreement shall be in effect until the earlier of the following: (a) the formal transfer of title and contract takes place, or (b) September 1, 2000. Conditions Precedent: The above stated price shall include delivery to the Moore Project site at ABB's sole expense. The exictor modifications required to make the Units operationally feasible in Canada will be made by ABB at no additional cost to ECC, and shall be made in the field or in the shop - at ABB's discretion - but in no case shall the delivery date of the units be later than November, 2000. The repair/replace terms of the contract shall be modified such that ECC shall be able to opt - at their sole discretion - to replace parts versus repairing them, in order to maximize run-time (and the determination as to what maximizes run-time shall also be in ECC's sole discretion). Eric, I will let you fill in the blanks on the other conditions that you want changed in the contract. I think I have captured the spirit of the deal here. I have attempted to cover us for intervention/interference issues. I am concerned about the Term provisions - how long do we want to keep this thing alive if ABB is unwilling to meet the terms we need to make this deal viable ? ",

While we will honor current commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to use the spot agreement to buy any more gas. The reason that this is happening is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now. We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of agreement most gas suppliers are familiar. We have the ordinance approved by the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep us operating. I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are doing. The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM. We will take the executed contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and, if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new year begins. This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem. I can't make any changes to this contract. There is a notice published in the LA Times about the availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying to do here. I Hope most of you will respond. Thanks (See attached file: Spot Gas Cover Letter.doc)(See attached file: New Spot Gas Contract.doc) - Spot Gas Cover Letter.doc - New Spot Gas Contract.doc ",

With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours. 2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I believe that both parties need to make such reps. The rep in Part 5 (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep below it. 3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different from the setoff language. What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the \"Defaulting Party\"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party. This is different from the exercise of setoff rights. 4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply. 5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars. 6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). Why do you want to delete it?

I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help. Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power. Looks like a free call for the next 30 years. Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.

        "clean_content": "Project Triple Lutz I wanted to update each of you on a number of matters: 1. On Tuesday of next week we plan to give copies of the Proposed Stock Purchase Agreement and Lease (sublease) to the interested bidders. The first data room visits are scheduled to occur on Thursday the seventh. Chris is going to circulate a revised draft of the Stock Purchase Agreement to everyone later today and everyone on the Enron team should have their comments to me by Friday evening. 2. With respect to the lease, in response to David's inquiry regarding section 3.06, I think we should leave in all the parts of 3.06. With respect to subpart (v) would it be possible to leave it in but just handle the issue of title etc as a rep. Also, I would like to add a change of control provision to the Lease and provide for a parent guarantee from an entity with a credit rating acceptable to Enron. I have yet to receive AnnMarie's comments and questions, but I think you should go ahead and generate a new draft for distribution Friday and AnnMarie will have the opportunity to comment on the revised draft. I would ask that the revised lease be reviewed by Trina Chandler and Ed Osterberg as well. Gail, please give me a call and we can coordinate getting the revised draft lease to the appropriate parties. 3. With respect to the unwind descriptions and the right to use agreement, I would appreciate an update and an estimate on when the unwind descriptions and a draft of the exclusive Right to Use agreement would be available. 4. We have now been informed by the accounting gurus that we can go ahead and transfer the Entex contract to the purchaser of HPL and not have to undo the marked to market position. As a result, we will transfer the Entex contract as well as the other contracts which cannot be in HPL to a new Enron and sell the stock in the new sub along with the HPL stock. There will be no need for a back to back contract. However, we will need to unwind the cash monetization transactions involving the Entex contract, as well as the one involving the Union Carbide contract. (there may be others and we are checking on them now.) That is all for now. I will keep you posted as things develop (and change!). Anne C. Koehler Sr. Counsel, ENA EB 3832 713-853-3448",

The Agreement can terminate under 15.1(e) if a \"Judgment\" (court order, regulatory order etc.) determines that, as a result of Hub Transactions, Peoples is subject to comprehensive regulation as a natural gas co. or loses its Hinshaw status. Under 15.2, the Agreement terminates if it is found void or illegal, or at the option of either party if found void or illegal in part with frustration of purpose. The intent of our wording in these sections, and the related definitions, is to eliminate the termination right (which was included in Peoples'intial draft) for a regulatory action, such as an ICC order which adopts an unfavorable ratemaking treatment for Hub revenues, but does not find the agreement to be illegal or void. The thought was that, after Peoples obtains an accpetable intial blessing from the ICC, the risk of some later regulatory action short of a finding of illegality should rest with Peoples during the Agreement's term.",

        "clean_content": " dfossum.nsf In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas under the tariff ought to be interpreted. Here is my list. Please add items if I've missed any. 1. When can TW \"selectively market\" available capacity? I.e., if capacity is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal? I think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to talk to one customer is always \"selective\" since there's only one guy on the phone, not all our customers. Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off the list of \"the usual suspects\" we call to pitch a special deal like an index to index deal or a discount? I've asked Lee to pull together a quick analysis of this issue. 2. If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open season context, how do we allocate it? This is the situation we got into a couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space. Are we always required to use a lottery? Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance? 3. What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate contracts? The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore). I think all neg. rate deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max rate strd language deals. 4. ??? I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.

        "clean_content": "FW: Revised Lease Model Current negotiations with AALLP has provided us \" a new look \" at the current lease model. It has loosened up somewhat to our benefit. AALLP has agreed to a \"two bucket\" approach as indicated on the attached matrix. Note that we may operate under this model until the EITF provides definitive guidance which is expected in December 2001. We should now focus on the O&M aspect of an existing or development project. If we pass bucket one as it relates to O&M and offtake limits of 95% or less, we will not be in a lease and do not proceed to bucket 2. Bucket two is essentially where we have been up to now. In a nutshell, if Enron does not operate, does not have the ability to hire and fire the operator (must have less than 50% voting on this), does not set or approve operating policies and procedures and takes 95% or less of the offtake, we should not be in a lease and we stop there. If we supply the fuel and take 95% or less of the offtake and pass O&M criteria, the fuel supply agreement must have significant LD's. See specifics for Bucket 1 on the attached. NOTE: Please keep us in the loop on new deals as we roll out this new model. We still need to scrub the deals in order to keep AALLP informed. Please distribute to those I have missed. R.

        "clean_content": "Kelly Farmout Agreement - Cypress Venture Teresa: Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital Resources' (ECR) Cypress Venture. The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge, without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible: Rozel Energy, led by Bill Rogers, identified a high potential / relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil & Gas (sub of Contour Energy). He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled 90%+ of the acreage, but it was set to expire on Sept. 28, 2000. Rozel, after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so, sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already top-leased a significant portion of the prospect. Had the Kelley lease expired, these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect. Rozel, with the help of Allen Wilhite, approached Kelley for a farmout. Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately 50% of its interest, or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option. Kelley elected to participate for 50% of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted. Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement. Kelley sought to operate the well, which ECR rejected due to Kelley's poor track record in drilling deep S. Louisiana wells. Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle. Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S. Louisiana, Stokes and Speiler, who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine, who each have over 25 years experience in mangement of drilling operations. Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute, the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was non-responsive to Allen's efforts to finalize the agreement. Allen, Craig Fox, Arvel Martin and I met with Kelley's Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport (we thought). The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept. 15th by Kelley and Allen. Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions, particularly who would operate. ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations. With Kelley's consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley, we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept. 28th lease expiration. Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded. I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October 16, 2000 (effective Sept. 15, 2000). Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelley's offices to deliver the document, I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no. I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs, and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions. I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements. The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directly-owned asset that I had encountered. I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GP's in our Juniper, Bonne Terre (historically) and Texland ventures, and a farmout with Enron's name on the line. It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review. I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOA's in directly owned assets (as opposed to LP's with a GP such as Juniper) require Legal review and signoff. The compliance meeting last week underscored that point. We had outside counsel (Lisa Jaubert) under your direction review the Tri-C and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval. I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue. The demands that our large oil & gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss. The Bonne Terre, Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue. Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA (to be held in BT Exploration LLC) will increase the legal and commercial activity level. We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next 10 days, so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S. Riceville prospect late next week. I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire. I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the mistake. I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the immediate future on our direct-owned ventures. I look forward to working with you on ways to better manage our business process in Cypress-Acadian, Bonne Terre & Vastar ventures. ",

        "clean_content": "Draft PG&E Letter PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Elizabeth: Attached is draft of the termination payment letter with a few suggested changes, but nothing major. I tried to include a blackline, but it seemed to get corrupted so I don't know if it will be of much use to you. A few notes: (1) I did not have the various contracts with me when I reviewed this, but I have asked Jim if he could make sure I did not make any inaccurate statements as well as input the few contract section references that are open and the information on the Canadian termination. (However, I was not sure whether you wanted Peter Keohane to input the relevant information on the Canadian side.). (2) In light of PG&E's letter to us, I thought we may want to make some short statements about the affiliate set off rights under the Bankruptcy Code in the termination letter. (3) I modified some of the language on the CalPX liabilities. I didn't have my exposure sheet with me, but I thought I recall that we were both owed money from the CalPX and that we had some risk on the chargeback liability depending on how FERC ultimately comes out on the issue. As you know, the FERC decision about 3 weeks ago prohibited the CalPX from proceeding with the chargeback \"under these circumstances\" or some type of language like this, but it seemed to have punted the final resolution of the issue until at least the commandeered contract valuation issue had been resolved--thus, although perhaps not likely, it seemed to me at the time that FERC gave itself an opening to reconsider the chargeback issue after the valuation determination had been made. (4) While I bracketed the language, I thought we may want to affirmatively and briefly set forth the business reason why EPMI is holding the direct access claim to at least give them something to think about. As we have discussed, PG&E's likely reaction will be that we are using unsupportable self help to not pay them anything on the termination of the 3 power confirmations by claiming a set off for the negative CTCs. To the extent we can articulate a short business rationale for EPMI having that claim, it may at least make them pause as to whether our business rationale arguably could prevail. (5) We note in the letter certain claims we have against PG&E that we are not setting off--e.g., the ISDA termination payment. We also reference the claims held by EPMI through the CalPX, even though we are not \"terminating\" any \"contracts\" in that respect. I assume that we do not want to reference in the letter the claims held by Portland General which \"route\" through the CalPX and the ISO, even though we are not claiming rights of offset for those. PG&E will be put on notice of those when we put in Portland's claims as part of our proof of claim with the bankruptcy court. I'll plan on getting together with you to review this tomorrow afternoon. Lastly, I have not read the decision yet, but I saw that the DC Circuit upheld FERC in all respects in the PCA case so since our contracts do not have to be on file, they can be terminated without waiting for the 60 day period to expire. That should reduce another potential challenge to the power contract termination. Thanks.

I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times. We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year. While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron. Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate. Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16. Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business. You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes. Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. Below is the proposed order for your presentations. Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone. Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am. Stan Horton - Global Services Louise Kitchen - Americas John Sherriff - Europe Mike McConnell - Global Markets Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets Janet Dietrich - Retail If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference. To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use. << File: Sample Bullet Slide.ppt >> Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference. The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera. In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me. I look forward to working with you. Regards, Terrie James Senior Director, Corporate Communication (ph) 713.853.7727 (fax) 713.646.3248 terrie.james@enron.com",

Subcontract Agreement with Instromet to Integrate Changes Requested by Instromet in Dec. 1999 and Other EM&MS Edits Part II, Section 1, Definitions. Modified to replace the definition of \"Test Period\" with \"Warranty Period\", and to define the latter as \"the period of time up to 30 days from the date Instromet receives the shipment of Work at Instromet's first point of destination\". Instromet's right to reject the completed Work by notifying Enron Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc. (EM&MS) in writing of the alleged defect must be exercised by Instromet during the Warranty Period or this right is waived. Instromet's sole remedy for defective goods is the repair or replacement by EM&MS. Part II, Section 6.2, Instromet Furnished Information, Data, Material, Equipment Services. Modified to limit Instromet's liability for consequences of defects in manufactured spools to defects in the data, material, equipment, supplies or services furnished by or through Instromet. Original draft also made Instromet liable for defects in supplies or services furnished by Enron Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc. Part II, Section 11, Title and Risk of Loss to Work. Modified to transfer title and all risk of loss in the Work to Instromet as of the date of Enron Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc.'s invoice statement to Instromet (whether or not Instromet has arranged for the shipment of the completed spools). Original draft placed risk of loss in the Work with Instromet at all times, and identified the Point of Delivery (Clifton machine shop) as the place of title-transfer. Part II, Section 12, Changes. Modified to provide for the completion of a Work Change Order form (attached to the Agreement as Exhibit C) to document changes in Work agreed to by the parties. Part II, Section 13, Standards of Performance and Limited Warranty. Modified to integrate the new Warranty Period definition discussed in the first bullet item above. Also modified to treat as a separate numbered section (Section 9, Indemnification for Third Party Claims) the indemnity obligation (regardless of the presence or absence of insurance coverage) of Instromet to EM&MS for third party claims for personal injury or property damage arising from EM&MS' Work . Section 9 is further modified to expressly exclude from Instromet's indemnity obligation the percentage of any claim that results from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of EM&MS. Section 9 is also modified to state the right of EM&MS to assume its defense of a third party claim if Instromet fails to assume the same per its indemnity obligation on being notified of the claim. Please note that under Section 8, Liabilities and Indemnifications for Other Than Third Party Claims, Instromet and EM&MS have agreed to release and hold each other harmless for claims of injury or death of person or loss or damage to property in favor of each party or its employees or its agents arising from the Work of EM&MS at the Clifton machine shop. Claims by Instromet's or EM&MS's independent contractors would be third party claims coverd by Section 9. Part II, Hazardous Materials, Waste, Pollution Section. This section was deleted in its entirety. Section 9, Indemnification for Third Party Claims, will cover the respective responsibilities of the parties for such claims. Part II, Intellectual Property Rights Section. Instromet was to provide EM&MS with its proposed alternate language for this section. EM&MS has not received this. Therefore, this separate Section was deleted by EM&MS and two of its provisions integrated elsewhere in the Agreement. The first, the provision concerning Instromet's representations and warranties of ownership of the processes and methods that Instromet requires EM&MS to use in its manufacture of the spools has been set out in a separate section, Section 14, Instromet's Representations and Warranties. Section 14 now stipulates that Instromet warrants that either Instromet, Inc. or its \"Affiliate\" own such processes or methods used in the Work and that all products provided by Instromet are free from third party claims of infringement of intellectual property rights. The second, the provision in the original \"Intellectual Propery Rights\" section concerning Instromet's obligation to indemnify EM&MS from third party intellectual property infringement claims has been removed and integrated into Section 9, Indemnification for Third Party Claims. Lastly, please note that Section 22.5, Confidential Information, now states that the parties' obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure shall continue for a period of 3 years after the termination of this Agreement. The original draft had stipulated that the confidentiality obligations shall terminate ___ years after the date of the disclosure of such confidential information. The change was made based on the difficulty of tracking different disclosure dates through the term of the Agreement. ",

This is still somewhat rough and will need considerable input from Don Hammond on the technical issues. We did not make any changes to the schedules and attachments this turn on the assumption that these will be addressed as we go forward (and are quite skeletal at this point in any case). We did endeavor to capture most of Mary Hain's comments from the prior email but as the new draft is so different from the prior one I am not sure we succeeded in all respects. The good news, of course, is that the new draft they sent is vastly superior to the old one for this application. We have tried not to make many \"redrafting\" changes but let us know if there is anything you feel we should revisit. We are continuing to review some items for further changes. Please note that there are questions in bold in the draft which are directed to ENA personnel and internal counsel and are not for distribution to Nevada Power and therefore this draft needs to be revised by us before it goes out to anyone outside of Enron. I apologize again for the delay in getting this to you but it has been extremely busy hereabouts of late. Please let me know when you'd like to discuss.

The Economist's US e-business series was founded in March 2000 with Summits in New York and Laguna Niguel California, and with the subtext \"Strategic business transformation for chief executives in the digital economy\". I am aware that you attended the event in Laguna Niguel, where John Chambers, Dan Nordstrom, and Kevin O'Connor were among the speaker faculty. The fall E-Business Summits are scheduled for October 2nd-3rd at the JW Marriott in Atlanta, and October 18th-19th at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago. I have attached preliminary drafts of the programme for both cities, which reflect a session dedicated to Enron Net Works. We are particularly interested in including a presentation on how Enron has leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the Internet economy, including the Net Works initiative to create B2B websites for other businesses and industries. We would be delighted to have you speak on this subject at either the Atlanta or Chicago Summit. I understand that you have already agreed to participate as a speaker in the 21st Century Internet Summit that will take place September 20-22 in Laguna Niguel CA. That event, which has been organised by my colleague Lisa Weiner, is targeted to an audience of CIOs in its focus on technology, whereas the E-Business Summit targets CEOs in its emphasis on strategic business transformation. Thank you for your consideration of this invitation and I look forward to following up with you following the holiday weekend.

        "clean_content": " chris germany 6-25-02.pst As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron. The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry. Thank you.

Under NIMO's \"Supplier Select\" program, credit appraisals and security requirements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted \"as financial evaluations dictate\". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective August 1, 2000. NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amount of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor is at the minimum rating (listed as \"BBB\" from S&P or Fitch or \"Baa2\" from Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, Fitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guarantor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii)the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New Yorkutility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely payments to the utility. If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit rating is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement will be lifted. See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2. In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its securityrequirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutually agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash deposit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approvedby the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial institution with at least an \"A\" bond rating; (iii) asecurity interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a guarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit rating of at least \"BBB\" by S&P or Fitch or \"Baa2\" by Moody's; (v) payments made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which will reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be required); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adequate security. See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4. For your information, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) after providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails to pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy(or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its customers under NIMO's Supplier Select program. See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.7. No prior notice is required under (ii). Please call me re: the above if you have questions/need additional information. MLC ",

Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once, i.e., people who got a piece of the pre-petition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan. 4) EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor. I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenroht's mistake. ( I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time.) Therefore, the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds, does not provide for separate D&O insurance and does not address the deal compensation.",

I understand that the loans will be unsecured but cross guarantied (i.e., Enron will guaranty the People's loans and vice versa), but I have several additional, basic questions re: the terms of the Enron loan and the intercreditor arrangements with Peoples. In terms of beginning drafting the loan documents, answers to questions 6(a) and 8 would be extremely helpful in selecting an appropriate form. 1. People's loan agreement -- will it be an exact clone of ours? 2. Guaranties -- will the cross-guaranties guaranty payment to the other venturer of all unpaid amounts under such venturer's loan agreement, or will they instead function more as an intercreditor/sharing agreement (i.e., if one venturer receives a payment that the other does not, the paid venturer will share its payment ratably with the unpaid venturer)? 3. Intercreditor Issues/Exercise of remedies -- Please confirm that there is to be no 100% lender vote requirement for acceleration, etc., and that each venturer can pursue remedies with respect to its loan independently (although I presume the facilities will be cross defaulted). 4. Advancing mechanics -- besides requiring ratable advances with the People's facility, will there be any conditions precedent to advances other than the typical no default/representations true & correct/no MAC? 5. Repayment -- will there be any commitment step-downs/mandatory prepayments? 6. Interest -- what will the (a) interest rate basis and (b) margin be? 7. Fees -- Will there be any sort of upfront fee? What will the commitment fee be? (And what will the amount of Enron's commitment be?) 8. Lender(s) -- Does Enron intend to keep its revolver as a single lender facility, or should we provide for a syndicated arrangement? 9. Other information -- When will specific financial covenant information be available? Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing. I look forward to working with you on this transaction.

There are two other items in addition to those mentioned in the note: In regards to e-mails we exchanged yesterday regarding the fact that these Principles are targeted at the extractive industry peer group that Enron tries to distinguish itself from and is largely exiting, I understand that Vicki will be contacting Kelly to discuss your suggestions on differentiating Enron from those industries. It is not clear whether the decision to endorse the Principles must be made by the full Enron board or some level short of the Enron board. I think Vicki will be discussing that with Rob.

I hope that I have given you most of the information you need to understand our concept and to be able to discuss it with your colleagues. We agreed that on my return to the UK I would set out how Enron might be involved at this stage and be one of the first US firms to pioneer the idea and become a GoodCorporation network member able to display the GoodCorporation trademark and start conversing with other members. Those members could be private companies, public sector entities or government departments, trade associations, NGOs etc. As we discussed the GoodCorporation Charter and processes are near completion . We are in the process of starting our pilot verifications which will be done by PwC, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Intertek, SGS and Bureau Veritas.We are also setting up an Accreditation Body ( which is being modelled on the Forestry Stewardship Council) to oversee the annual verification process. The pilot programme provides companies with an excellent opportunity to have a low risk way of trying out the process and seeing if it works in their organisation. They can submit the whole or a small part of the organisation. Pilot companies pay for the verifiers' time only and the verifiers are giving their time at cost ($750/ day.) The pilot itself will take the form of a preliminary scoping meeting in which the verifier will take the company through the evidence (policies and procedures) that need to be in place in order to pass the GoodCorporation charter. The meeting will decide who needs to be interviewed, in which locations and therefore the number of days involved. As the emphasis is on verifying policies and the way they are implemented in the workplace rather than a full scale audit of impact, the number of days involved should be relatively limited. During the actual verification, the verifier will check for the evidence by reviewing documentation provided by the company, in addition to a series of meetings with the relevant people, such as the HR Director, Environmental Manager, Finance Directors and customer-facing staff. Assuming it is successful, the piloted part of the company can then become a member of the network if they so choose. It would be great to have Enron involved in this early piloting. Given your current policies and ethics I wouild be surprised if the charter posed any real problem for you . It could also be a useful supply chain tool for you to encourage your suppliers not only to say they behave in the manner you wish them to behave but also demonstrate this behaviour to you and the outside world in a transparent fashion. Please get back to me if you require any further clarification and of course I and my colleagues would be delighted to meet whoever else you need to get involved before a decision is made. Again, many thanks for your time and I was delighted that you were enthusiastic about our concept. With very best regards Vicky Pryce Chairman, GoodCorporation ",

        "clean_content": " sneal.nsf It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen. We recognize that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron's business goals, and we are pleased that many of you have shared in the company's financial success through Enron stock options. As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program. Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron's continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package. On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program). It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, is as follows: ? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations. ? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.) ? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000. ? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant of stock options. Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program, among other good reasons=01( that's why. In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your questions, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your Human Resources representative. Note: In addition to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, granting of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron companies' employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refine the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

        "clean_content": "Wildhorse Letter Confidential Work Material - Attorney Client Privilege Attached for review is a draft of the letter to be sent to Wildhorse concerning the Gathering Agreement under which the Entrada and Dakota production is committed. Please review and provide comments. To summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement: 1. Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday. Brett also forwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse. The correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings conducted between Enogex and Wildhorse. No demands were made by Enogex and no claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse. Brett stated that the Entrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications. Enogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or Questar. I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release the gas. He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo negotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse. 2. I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa. Nothing really useful. There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area called Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought these assets were in a state of economic viability decline. Unfortunately this letter was not directed to Enogex. However, the draft letter takes that position with Wildhorse. 3. I am securing local consul out of Denver. I want someone intimately familiar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective to be involved. We may need to seek a declaratory order. We have run into to conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown. Should have this resolved on Monday. 4. Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the declaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse. This draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas. However, to reiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right to deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement. The fact that the Entrada Gas is not in spec. with the downstream pipelines for inerts, allows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in default. ",

There are business and legal reasons for the APS being in the name of Enron Corp. If we sell a company and the APS was in the name of a subsidiary, we would have to get the sold subsidiary to license the computer software to us. Given the inability to determine this at the time everyone is pushing to sell the subsidiary, we could end up without any software or having to pay a substantial amount of money to the buyer later on when we discover the mistake. Secondly, allowing all subsidiaries to negotiate different versions with vendors would be a nightmare and create five times the number of agreements to file. I am opposed to this. Every time we sell a company, the software has always been an issue. We are as I told you before trying to fix something that is not broken. ",

Specifically, I would appreciate the following: 1. Please send me a copy of the CFTC no action letter that we discussed last week. 2. Please prepare a memorandum outlining the issues to be addressed in reviewing internally-generated content, e.g. (a) CTA concerns; (b) general advisor issues; (c) other general resposibilities of a publisher, such as truth, accuracy. (As I mentioned, I think it would be helpful to have some general insights from someone with a publishing background.) Additionally, are there any particular issues to be addressed with regard to content generated by an outside consultant like Cynthia Case who prepares a case study for EnronOnline containing generic advise and who also provides advisory services to third parties. As you requested, I am faxing to you a few examples of content that has been developed for Phase II to date. If you run into any red flags, please let me know at your earliest opportunity. Time is of the essence, and the text that I am sending you has already gone out to the site developer for html formatting. 3. Please review the current Legal and Privacy Information I am forwarding to you and revise to incorporate necessary modifications and/or additions. 4. Mark and I have discussed the issue of appropriate disclaimers in some length. Currently, the Legal and Privacy Information link is discretely tucked beside the copyright notice on the home page. We have asked that the home page instead include an addition at the bottom of the text referencing Legal and Privacy Information: \"Please see Legal and Privacy Information [link] for terms governing your use of the web site.\" The home page links to a page entitled \"EnronOnline Markets\", which links to various commodity \"home\" pages. On each of the EnronOnline Markets and commodity pages, we would like to add the following text as well: \"Your company should not enter into any transaction unless it fully understands the potential risks and rewards of that transaction and has independently determined that the transaction is appropriate in light of your company's objectives, experience, financial and operational resources, and other relevant circumstances. Please bear in mind that in providing this web site, Enron is acting as a potential arm's length counterparty and not as your company's adviser. For further information, please see Legal and Privacy Information [link].\" These additions to the site are pending EnronOnline approval, but I would welcome any general thoughts you may have. I am receiving 2-5 pieces of content for review, and after my review, each piece of content is forwarding to the site developer for formatting. As you can appreciate, timing is critical so that we can minimize the required reformatting. Thank you so much for your assistance! Leslie Hansen (713) 853-6121",

Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company. Broadening participation will result in increased access to information as decisions are made and will allow committee members to extend their working relationships and influence throughout the company. The committee charters and memberships are set forth below. Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance. We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair. VP PRC The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.

I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the following high points: 1. The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers. If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology. 2. The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and after October 2. 3. All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just the State of California and its IOU's. Enron is a net purchaser in these markets. 4. Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR. The details of these points appear in the attached document. The Judge was receptive to most points. He understood the problems that the June 19 methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation. He agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology. Although he agreed that the refund methodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the Commission. The Judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome. I urged the Judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds, as the Commission did in its June 19 order with its RTO filing requirement. The judge was noncommittal on this, although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset. Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday. The Judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday, and that the comments would accompany the recommendation. Thereafter, it is likely that the Commission would defer to the Judge's recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine \"unresolved issues of material fact\". The scope of the hearing has not been determined, but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology. ",

Here is the background on a possible acquisition that we have brought up with them: Enron Metals is very interested in pursuing further discussions with Atlantic Copper on the acquisition of their smelter in Spain. Estimated capital would be US$350 Million. Acquiring this asset gives us the opportunity to build copper and copper concentrate positions and more effectively managing our positions in the market place. We would finance this off balance sheet. Mr. James Targetta, head of Atlantic Copper (copper smelter and refinery in Spain and fully owned by Freeport McMoran) had a conversation with James Moffet, Chairman of Freeport McMoran last Friday informing him about our preliminary conversations. Moffet advised Targetta not to proceed further until he speaks to you since he has known you for 25 years. In addition, Targetta mentioned the possibility for Enron purchasing all the copper mining activities of Freeport McMoran which would leave them as an oil and exploration company. We think there are some great possibilities here. If you have not heard from him in the next few days, I would really appreciate you giving Moffet a call. I would be more than happy to get a more extensive briefing for you if you think you need it. I look forward to discussing this further with you. John",

I reviewed with the Calgary office the latest draft you e-mailed; listed below are the remaining questions: Part 1 of the Schedule; subitem (k) with reference to romanette (ix) - the term \"Performance Assurance\" should be changed to \"Eligible Credit Assurance\" (same as in subitem (f) of Part 1). Part 4 of the Schedule; subitem (h) Governing Law - question was asked about Texas being the choice of law as opposed to New York. Our understanding is that the ISDA was structured under the guidance of New York law and request that Governing Law be changed to New York. Paragraph 13(c)(iv), Notification Time - request that the time be changed to 1:00 p.m. Paragraph 13 - the remaining issues (listed below) will be discussed by Mr. Harry Wijsman in Calgary's Credit Department with Mr. Bill Bradford. These same issues were discussed during the ISDA negotiations with PanCanadian Petroleum and Enron's Canada office. The items are: Paragraph 13(b)(iv)(C) - Minimum Transfer Amount Paragraph 13(g)(ii)(2) - Use of Posted Collateral Paragraph 13(m)(i) - Material Adverse Change Irrevocable Transfer Letter of Credit: transferability and automatic extension language.

EBS may have some Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed materials (while being paid by Enron). Eric is in the driver's seat with the contract at this point. I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one form or another with BMC product and/or personnel. In it, they have been requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles: Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness of the BMC flexibility w/regard to \"purchase commitment\", etc. In addition, I have re-iterated the time urgency. I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them: Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith. I am meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm. Matson, Ogg, and Smith have me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call me back. Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for them: how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue? Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years? Have I properly conveyed the \"accepable-to-BMC method\" of proving purchase commitment from Enron? Your note re: getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th? I will call you to follow up on this note. Thank you, Jeff Youngflesh",

        "clean_content": "June 16th draft of swap assignment Jeff: Just a few comments: 1. In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words \"due to\" need to be put after the word \"means\" in the first line. 2. In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae \"as it relates to the Assigned Interest\" has now been deleted. Pursuant to my earlier comment on this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment piece of this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happens to Pelican . Is that the way it is supposed to work? If so, plaese explain why. 3. With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying in the first sentence of such Section \"the amount determined...\" shouldn't it say \"the fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the Transaction\". Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed Matters and it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or Termination Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occur. What is the priocedure for coming up with this amount? Does each party calculate it and then send it to the experts or do the experts just determine it?

Thanks Tracy -----Original Message----- From: Schwarzbach, Stephen Sent:Monday, August 27, 2001 5:17 PM To:Killen, Faith; Geaccone, Tracy; Tran, Agatha; Lee, Dana Subject:Request: Current Headcount Hi everyone. I have yet another request for which I need your input. Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s). What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey. For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments. It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world). I say \"department\" because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc. If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss. The data needs to be as recent as possible. Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1. If you have more recent data, that would be great. At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.) It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request. Additionally, if you can provide me with a \"current estimate\" for the groups you report, that would be ideal. I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE. The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both. If you can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we can discuss. Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon. This will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions. If you have any questions, please give me a call. Thanks, Steve PS--Here are the BUs I expect each of you: Faith (also, let me know if you'd prefer me to email this to each group instead of going through you) ENA Europe EGM EIM ENW EPI EEOS EBS Tracy ETS PGG EREC Agatha EGAS Dana EES",

Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?

Basically, do we have the contracts in place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through? Dave Baumbach x35384 ",
