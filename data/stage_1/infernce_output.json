Or what did they sign and send back to us? I am interested in the pricing and the terms of the deal. 2) Evan - is it possible to get a copy of a bill that we send to a residential customer just to see what one looks like. Evan - can you also tell me if there is anything difficult for the residential customers in being switched back? What should they expect to see? Will their bill be messed up for a while? Are there procedural things that need to change? How long does it take? What might the new bill look like? 3) Lamar - could you have someone validate the position we have in the book (PV volume and dollar exposure - pre and post rate increase) 4) Peggy / Beth - can we meet and brainstorm how to communicate our \"good bye\" to these customers. One idea: perhaps we could ask Devon to help us send residential customers a letter showing them 100 ways to reduce their energy bill by changing their behavior or spending less than $100 at Home Depot on energy conservation enablers. Then, as part of our good by, we could send them a $100 gift certificate to Home Depot. This, along with a clear communication on what to expect in their billing cycle and what they might expect from the utility. - our message might be?: \" we have always been able to price differently than the utility, but due to market conditions wereally aren't going to be able to maintain that \"pricing advantage\" that you have enjoyed for the last several years. Since our company is based on helping our customers create extra value, and since we can't find any extravalue, we will be moving you back to utility service. As we go, don't letit be said that we aren't always thinking about creating extra value, so here are 100 ideas and a $100 dollar certificate to home depot. Just implemenenting 10 of these ideas could reduce your energy bill by 25%. In the end, lower the overall cost of energy is what it is all about. As we get newideas, we'll be in touch.....\" Just an example...but something like that.... 5) Carol: could you schedule a meeting for us to review this stuff say Tuesday? Please email ideas or comments prior to the meeting. Vicki, if we have theinfo from #1, I am not sure you or an associate need to attend. I think Evan, someone from project Golden Bear, Peggy and/or Beth, and Evan. Thanks all. <Embedded StdOleLink> <Embedded StdOleLink>",

This 100% employee-driven program is so successful because you take time to nominate and recognize those individuals that are special in your work life. Every single candidate is to be congratulated! This year, the original concept was brought to fruition when the members of the 1999 Chairman's Roundtable took over the selection process and carried the torch from past to present. This Selection Committee reviewed all candidates on the basis of their ability to consistently bring our values to life and sought out those select few that are Enron's \"everyday heroes\". It is with great pleasure that we announce the 2000 Chairman's Roundtable whose daily pursuit of excellence, commitment to communication, genuine integrity and respect for others are what make Enron the incredible company that it is today - innovative, successful and undoubtedly one of the best places to work.

If you refer to the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no value for either of the deals. I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks, Kate",

Dear Investor, Louis Navellier, the financial advisor who has helped his subscribers beat the market more than 3-to-1 over the past three years, has just completed a Special Report I thought you'd want to know about. Called Wall Street's Next Big Blue Chip Winners, this report reveals Louis' market-beating strategy for choosing the right stocks and explains how you can position your portfolio for tremendous profits -- even in today's tough market conditions. Plus, it details 8 powerful stocks that are set to reap you fast profits: The top software blue-chip of the Internet age. This company has quickly become the global leader in \"firewall protection.\" Simply put, firewalls keep hackers and viruses out... keeping corporate networks secure. And that is a huge growth business. This company's sales should reach $425 million this years, a 93% increase over last. And there's no slowdown in sight. The time is right for you to get in for great gains in the upcoming months! The \"most surprising\" company on Wall Street. Analysts keep getting the profit forecasts wrong, wrong, wrong! But that's no surprise to anyone inside the technology industry. While chipmakers like Intel and AMD battle over shrinking markets, this dynamic innovator carved out the leadership position in high-tech's \"next big thing.\" As demand shifts from deskbound PCs to new Internet technologies, this company owns the most lucrative high-bandwidth markets... positioning itself (and you if you invest right away) in the sweet spot of the technology boom. Money-doubler in 4 to 6 months? The potential is certainly there -- and that may prove to be a very conservative target. This company has developed one of the most important medical devices of the last 20 years. And the lucrative markets for its products grow wider every day. Don't miss out! Plus 5 more rock-solid companies with great profit-making potential! Each one of these companies is on a record-setting roll -- stealing market share like mad... recording staggering sales and profit gains... and setting new productivity standards in its industry. And each company's stock is likely to soar 25%, 50% or more over the next 2 to 4 months alone. There's no time to waste.

        "content": "Minnesota/Price RIsk Management All--earlier this week the Minnesota PUC and the Department of Commerce jointly hosted a workshop on on \"LDC RIsk Management\". There was a presentation by Ken Costello from NRRI based on a paper that he has written; a panel consisting of reps from Reliant Minnegasco, Xcel, UtiliCorp, Alliant and MDU Resources (Great Plains); and a presentation from Blake Herndon of Williams Energy. The discussion focused exclusively on natural gas--nothing on power. Two of the five Commissioners sat in on parts of the presentation along with a number of staffers. There was (as always seems to be the case) no clear indication from the workshop what actions would take place as a result of the discussion. My sense would be that there may be an investigatory or study docket opened, but not a formal proceeding that would lead to any meaningful policy implementation requiring risk management to be utilitzed. I think that the PUC is open to approving modest plans that the LDC might bring before them, but they are not willing to be proactive. Although it was not stated publically, in my private conversations with the utilities I got a strong sense that Xcel would be coming with some type of proposal--possibly a request for pass thru on limited premium costs. Alliant and MDU will not, and I think Utilicorp will do something along the lines of filing for a fixed price option that will be offered to their residential customers. As I had indicated in a previous e mail, Reliant has already gotten approval for pass thru of call option premiums and I think that they are also petitioning for a fixed price option for residential customers. Call if you have any questions--#612-339-4599-- or would like copies of any materials.",

BP states they need to have the volumes/contract number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by 9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options: 1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change the contract numbers internally. 2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

So, some financial risk is possible. The language follows. We will endeavor to get the language removed (long-shot) or clarified (also long-shot). The new draft says ...\"we suspend the right to enter into new contracts for direct access effective today. All other issues dealing with contracts signed before today remain under consideration by the Commission (in response to the comments already received) and will be resolved in a subsequent decision. In other words, no contracts for direct access may be signed after today; the effect to be given to contracts signed before today, including renewals of such contracts, will be addressed in a subsequent decision.\" The \"Conclusions of Law include: \"2. The right to enter into new contracts for direct access should be suspended as of the date of this order. 3. The effect to be given to contracts signed before today, including renewals of such contracts, as well as comments of the parties will be addressed in a subsequent decision.\" And the \"Ordering\" paragraph states: \"[3.] The right to enter into new contracts for direct access is suspended as of the date of this order.\" \"5.

        "content": "Sempra tax rate Greg and Chris, As best we can tell, Sempra is not in a position currently to use section 29 tax credits. This is based on the following bits of evidence. 1. A company cannot claim section 29 tax credits in years when it pays no taxes or pays them under the alternative minimum tax (rather than the regular corporate income tax). 2. Section 29 credits cannot be carried forward. A company must use them or lose them. The one exception is in a year when the company is on the alternative minimum tax, the credit turns into a so-called AMT credit and can be carried forward. It must be used in that case in the first year the company comes off the AMT. 3. It appears from Sempra's 10-K that it was in a net operating loss position in 2000. The company shows \"current\" federal income taxes of -$8 million. It also shows \"deferred\" federal income taxes last year of $207 million. According to Morris Meltzer, tax director at PG&E's unregulated affiliate, this means that the company had more book income than taxable income last year. The deferred tax liability reflects the taxes the company expects to have to pay in the future as a result of this disparity. 4. Sempra's 10-Q for the first quarter 2001 shows positive current tax liability of $74 million. However, Jack Casey, vice chairman of Meridian Investments, told me that Sempra expects to be in a net operating loss position for the year. Meridian has been hired by Sempra to sell Sempra's interest in the Carbonronics syncoal facilities. I asked Casey why Sempra wants to sell -- is it because it can't use the tax credits or because it has soured on investing in syncoal projects given all the bad publicity? Casey said it cannot use the tax credits. In other news, the IRS has not budged on its plan to limit the capacity of plants to which it issues rulings to absurdly low numbers. The industry has complained to the Treasury, and there have been discussions at senior levels of Treasury and the IRS, but no reports back on where these internal talks are headed. Detroit Edison has a meeting with the IRS on its ruling request next Tuesday. The IRS has said it will limit capacity at the DTE facility to 198,000 tons a year. I assume you saw the article last Thursday in the Wall Street Journal about syncoal projects. It was on the front page. As far as I can tell, all proposed sales of syncoal plants in the market are on hold. This is a consequence of the Wall Street Journal article and the impasse with the IRS over capacity. The industry is starting to think it may have won a political battle earlier this year at Treasury, but lost the war. The IRS bureaucrats will have the final say. Joe Makurath, the IRS rulings group chief, said he is getting a number of FOIA requests for documents about projects on which the IRS has already ruled. He said he intends to be liberal in releasing information. There are rumors that the Wall Street Journal may be one of the organizations seeking information and may be at work on a followup article. The IRS launched an audit of four projects in West Virginia and Virginia that many people consider to be on the best end of the spectrum. The projects already have rulings that they qualify for credits. The IRS appears to be gathering evidence to argue that they did not get into service in time to qualify for tax credits or else that the projects failed to comply with the rulings. It is sending out big guns from Chicago, and one agent told the taxpayer that the IRS national office said \"don't worry about expense on this one.\" I will try over the weekend to give you my comments on the deposition transcripts. Sorry for the delay. If you don't find them when you come in on Monday, they will be first on my to-do list that morning.
