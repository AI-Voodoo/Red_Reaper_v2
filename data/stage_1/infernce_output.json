        "content": "Organizational Changes We are making a number of significant organizational changes. These changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives: First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position. Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships. Particularly with Joe Sutton's departure, the ability to directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult. Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yielding asset positions. And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities. ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses. The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension of Enron's wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets. Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets operations, and will be expanded to include Enron's Net Works business unit as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets. In addition, Enron's merchant businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below. Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assume the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services. Greg Whalley, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer. Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions: Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibility for managing all of Enron's existing energy asset portfolio outside of North America and Europe. Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI. Rebecca and Jim will report to the EWS Office of the Chairman. Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for the Middle East and Asia region. Sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region will report to Sanjay. In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office of the Chairman. In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for Enron's wholesale energy business in India and will transition this business into Enron Global Assets in the near future. Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined EBS as Chief Commercial Officer. Diomedes will be located in London and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors. Diomedes will report to the EBS Office of the Chairman. Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EES to lead EES' commercial efforts outside North America and Europe. In order to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron South America. Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services. Following the transition, Jim will join EES. In addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions: Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg's previous responsibilities as Presidentand CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for operating Enron's South and Central America asset base, all trading, marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity, Enron Americas. Enron Americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South America. Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Americas. Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron's businesses in Australia and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer. Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have responsibility for Enron's Middle East and LNG operations. With the exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance, equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products. Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets' organization, under the leadership of Jeff McMahon, President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged. Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed by, the individual business units. We are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS. To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units. These newly defined roles are as follows: Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Office Operations across EWS. These services will become part of Enron Net Works, with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. This alignment creates a coordinated services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these services. Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible for specific commodities and/or geographic locations. Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS. Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized on a regional basis. Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all European and Eastern Hemisphere operations. Rick and Mark will also continue to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff. Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a regional basis. Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity, Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets. Jackie Gentle will continue in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Ambler will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets. These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications. Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to cover EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America. Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale Services which summarizes the changes described here. As this organization continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes. ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AND ENRON WIND As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investments around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to EGEP and EWC. As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Cliff Baxter's direction. Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of Enron Wind, will report to Cliff. CORPORATE STAFF We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources, Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration. In that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff. COMMITTEE STRUCTURE In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron's growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our business unit leaders. The primary role of this committee will continue to be the communication of relevant information across Enron's businesses and the coordination of activities across those businesses. We will also be drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list. We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Committee. This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel management policy and corporate strategy. The Enron Corporate Policy Committee membership is also shown on the attached list. We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to our highest return opportunities. Please join us in congratulating and supporting all of these individuals in their new roles. ",

Its easier to complete a project early and send out the info prior to the due date, then to have to go back and ask for more time. Depending on the size of the plant and location, we may be faced with a lot of checking equipment records and field checks to verify ratings.

Jay and I are trying to get the DC attorneys on the phone to incorporate some changes. In particular, Enron wants us to put in a shorter time for completing the Interconnection Facilities study (60 rather than 90 days). Enron says we would still have the flexibility to take longer if we notify the customer that we need more time. How do Dave and Jim feel about that proposal?",

Stay tuned for updates. Enron Global LNG Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market. The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe. LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels. Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market. IN THE NEWS Enron Corp. Says First-Quarter Profit Rose 20 Percent Houston, April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent as sales almost quadrupled. Profit from operations rose to $406 million, or 47 cents, from $338 million, or 40 cents, in the year-earlier period. Enron raised its 2001 profit forecast to $1.75 to $1.80 a share, from its January projection of $1.70 to $1.75. First-quarter revenue surged to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion as Enron boosted the volume of power sold in North America by 90 percent. Enron had a first-quarter gain of $19 million, or 2 cents a share, for an accounting change, making net income $425 million, or 49 cents a share. There were no charges or gains in the year-earlier period.

They've done a very good job of setting up a strong financial desk and a strong physical desk and we don't see any problem with it. I think they have set up their books in a way that they truly have separation between the regulated and unregulated aspects of their business.\" Ross had prefaced the remark, midway through a heated debate on affiliate abuses, with the comment that \"this is not an industry-wide problem. I believe there are good and bad players in the market today.\" Earlier, Enron's Leslie Lawner had invited \"all of you to spend the day on Enron's trading floor, because I assure you, you will not see a more competitive environment anywhere. There is no way these folks, who fight like cats and dogs among themselves, would voluntarily transfer value to the pipeline group for the good of the bottom line.\" Lawner had to quickly back off the invitation - mentioning confidentiality restrictions - when it appeared about half the room was ready to troop over to the trading floor.

        "content": "Proposed Answer of CMUA's Complaint As you have already heard, California Municipal Utilities Association fileda complaint with FERC asking for cost based rates. The following is a brief outline of an EPMI/EES answer to the complaint. The answer is due Friday. Please send me any comments ASAP. ? The complaint should be rejected because it wrongly assumes that the Commission has no option to ensure just and reasonable rates but to require cost based rates because there is no low cost solution to the problems currently faced by the California markets. We should attach our white paper to our protest and state that the paper explains how these problems could be solved at little or no cost to the customers. ? I list here, for your information, the reasons CMUA claims that markets are not competitive (these reasons will not be re-listed in the pleading). ? 2000 prices greatly exceeded 1999 prices without regard to load. ? zonal constrained prices, even in the off-peak hours, do not reflect competitive outcomes for low load conditions. ? even small players can be price setters ? The changes required are additional generation, transmission, and demand response and will cost tens of millions of dollars and take lengthy periods of time to implement. ? There is no evidence that markets will ensure just and reasonable rates in the near future. ? CMUA asserts that with the advent of electric restructuring, the Commission has increasingly allowed energy and ancillary services to be sold at market-based rates. However, CMUA is wrong in the context of the West where there has been market-based trading of electricity before electric restructuring, since the FERC approved the Western Systems Power Pool's contract in 1991. The Commission's rules didn't create the wholesalemarket in the past, the market did and it was running fine until it was messed up by certain market rules were imposed that are enumerated in our paper. The problem is not the market-based rates. The problem is the market rules. ? CMUA's motion does not address how market-based rates would be calculated for marketers that do not sell power from their own resources, let alone reflect the trading of basis points. Almost all of the power EPMI sells is power it has bought from some other marketer or generator. Many of EPMI=01,s deals are done through brokers such that EPMI does not find out the identity of the seller until after a deal has been struck. Accordingly, EPMI gets no information about the cost of the underlying generation. ? If FERC doesn't try to fix the market but simply takes away our market-based rates, since there's is no basis for us to set cost based rates, we would go out of business. Besides there's no reason to take away our market-based rates because we are not exercising market power. So if FERC could fix the problem with a less onerous solution (as we've proposed inour white paper), requiring cost-based rates would constitute a regulatory taking of our business and we would have to be compensated using the constitutional standard. CMUA does not provide any expert testimony to support its position. Rather, its evidence is =01&drawn from materials prepared and testimony delivered by the California ISO and other public sources.=018 Beyond the difficult evidentiary issue posed by the fact that CMUA cannot swear to the veracity of information produced by third parties, EPMI would have no opportunity to conduct discovery or cross-examine of such =01&witnesses.=018 ",

        "content": " dfossum.nsf I got a call from Tino Monaldo today passing on the results of Dennis Langley's meeting with DOE in Albuquerque. DOE indicated that their current PNM rate is \"5.3 cents, exclusive of the demand charge.\" Tino's consultant claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of approximately 7 cents/KWh. Assuming we need to come in at 10% less than the current rate, our bogey is 6.3 cents/KWh. This is at the high end of the range we hoped they'd be in. Additionally, DOE indicated that they need \"redundancy\" and don't want to rely on PNM for back up power. They want a multiple turbine facility--i.e., more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines. The new pipeline will need to be split connected to El Paso and TW in order to access diverse supplies and guard against supply failure. They have not asked for fuel oil backup. I know this is starting to look like the project that won't go away, but the power price number looks very promising to me. I think its worth scrubbing down the model we've used to replace the generic capital cost and O&M assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine configuration we'd be using. If this price is really as favorable as I think, can we make another run at the ENA people and Federal Solutions guys to see if they have any interest? DF ",

Even if Bowen gets cooperation on her legislation, Allan believes she doesn't really want to do it and is not sure she can get a signature. I told him that Burton said he would sign off on a direct access bill if Bowen agrees to it. That gave him little encouragement because he doesn't see much motivation for Bowen to press on the Governor and Angelides. Allan's view corresponds with everyone we've spoken to whobelieve that nothing major will happen legislatively.

Craver said the utility formally asked for an extension in a Tuesday morning conference call. Failure to get one could tip the utility much closer to bankruptcy, though Craver said the banks aren't looking to worsen the power crisis. ``My view of the relationship with the banks is that it's strong, and that they are, generally speaking, looking for ways to be cooperative and constructive in this process,'' he said. SoCal Edison, California's No. 2 utility, and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the No. 1 utility and unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG - news), are trying to avoid bankruptcy. They have been unable to recover about $12 billion because of a rate freeze imposed under California's 1996 utility deregulation law, which has left them unable to pass on their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers. SoCal Edison has about $800 million of debts due this week. On Thursday a grace period to pay about $206 million of principal and interest on a five-year note issue expires. Pacific G&E and its parent are also in default of various credit lines. Creditors including independent power suppliers Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN - news), Mirant Corp. (NYSE:MIR - news) and Reliant Energy Inc. (NYSE:REI - news), meanwhile, are threatening to send both utilities into bankruptcy if they don't pay their debts. Gov. Gray Davis and the state legislature are expected soon to create a plan that could allow the utilities to pay down some of their debt. Craver said ``we're not betting the farm on getting a proposal'' by Friday. Shares of Edison International, which is based in Rosemead, Calif., closed Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $12.10, down 43 cents. PG&E shares closed on the Big Board at $12.30, down 25 cents. Several bank lenders declined on Tuesday to discuss how they plan to address the utilities' defaults. Bank One Corp. (NYSE:ONE - news), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C - news) and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM - news) are among PG&E's lenders, while Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC - news), Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase are among the lenders to SoCal Edison and its parent. ``We do not comment on customer relations,'' said Bank One spokesman Tom Kelly. J.P. Morgan Chase declined to discuss the matter. Bank of America and Citigroup did not return phone calls. ",

One could bet that Barbara Streisand is one happy camper. dsg April 6, 2001 Judge Dismisses Complaints by Groups To Stop NYPA From Opening Plants Associated Press A Brooklyn judge ruled Friday that the New York Power Authority can proceed with plans to open nine new metropolitan area power plants, rejecting the complaints of a coalition of consumer groups. The decision by state Supreme Court Justice Lawrence Knipel came just two days after a Queens judge had blocked the opening of two of the gas turbine generators in the Long Island City section of Queens. The anti-power plant groups \"failed to demonstrate that [NYPA] abused their discretion or violated any rule of law\" in efforts to open the plants, Judge Knipel wrote in his 76-page decision. NYPA and the other groups named in the suit \"exercised a level of care sufficient to pass legal muster\" Judge Knipel continued. Mike Petralia, spokesman for the New York Power Authority, hailed the judge's decision as \"a good day for all New York City residents. Now we can move forward to get the plants operational, and keep the lights on this summer.\" Mr. Petralia said NYPA hopes to have the plants up and running by early June. The plants are scheduled to open in Brooklyn, Queens, the South Bronx and Brentwood on Long Island. New York State Judge Issues Order to Stop Work on Queens Power Plant (April 5) Jason Babbie of the New York Public Interest Group, one of the groups seeking to keep the plants from opening, said his group was unsure if it would appeal this latest decision. \"We are considering an appeal,\" said Mr. Babbie, the environmental policy analyst for NYPIRG. \"We are upset about the decision. ... The government has spent money, in effect, fighting against its own people.\" The Brooklyn ruling does not supersede the earlier ruling in Queens, according to both sides, since the two suits were filed on different grounds. \"There is no green light,\" said Mr. Babbie. According to Mr. Petralia, NYPA is in negotiations with residents of the Queens neighborhood to clear the way for those plants to become operational. Opponents included Silvercup Studios, which produces the HBO series, \"The Sopranos.\" The New York Power Authority has said it must get the plants running by summer to ensure reliable electrical service and avoid price spikes. NYPA officials warn that New Yorkers could face the same problem currently afflicting California unless something is done.",

        "content": "SDG&E Emergency Interruptible Program 05/03/2001 05:29 PM SDG&E has filed today an emergency petition to modify the interruptible program decision to offer a special programin San Diego County. Since several AReM members continue to do business in sDG&E's service territory, you might be interested in it. The program is to be known as the Rolling Blackout Reduction Program (RBRP). SDG&E proposes to deploy customer-owned backup emergency generators during any ISO-declared Stage 3 event, to bring additional generation on-line to reduce the need to have rolling blackouts. Based on discussions with customers, SDG&E expects that approximately 75 to100 additional megawatts (MW) of additional power could be made available through this proposed program. These additional megawatts of demand reduction are critical to offset San Diego's anticipated share of ISO mandated statewide firm load reductions. SDG&E expects that the ISO will most likely require 1,000 MW of statewide reductions during Stage 3 firm load reduction events. SDG&E's share of this 1,000 MW is 7.4% or 74 MW. Therefore, 75 to 100 MW of additional backup generation can reasonably be expected to reduce the number and duration of rotating outages in San Diego. The RBRP is designed to run for a year, beginning on May 15, 2001 and pay capacity incentives each month for six months starting May 15, 2001 and continuing through November 15, 2001. Its availability for Summer 2002 will be determined after the upcoming summer. SDG&E proposes that this program be implemented only in San Diego county at this time. Participating customers must have a backup emergency generator that is capable of providing at least 15 percent of customers' annual maximum demand, but not less than 100 kW. Customers' participation in the program is entirely voluntary but would require a firm commitment and be supported by both a contract and other tariff obligations, terms, and conditions. As discussed more fully below, participating customers will earn incentive payments for their actual load reduction, and in addition, if a customer's load reduction is sufficiently great, the customer also will receive a circuit exemption. Once SDG&E receives notification from the ISO that a Stage 3 event and rolling outages have been declared, SDG&E would, in turn, notify participating customers to reduce demand through the use of their backup generation. Customers would be required to reduce demand as quickly as possible but no later than 15 minutes after the customer receives the notification. SDG&E would offset the amount of generation brought on line against the amount specified by the ISO the Stage 3 event for the load curtailment to achieve the necessary load drop. If SDG&E were required to curtail more load than the backup generation provides, or should load reduction be required faster than the generators could be started, then SDG&E would follow its normal curtailment plan to meet the full ISO requirement for load reduction, net of the load reduction on the system caused by the customer-owned backup generation. The backup generators will run until ISO no longer requires a firm load reduction and all firm load is back in service. SDG&E's proposed tariff imposes no program limits on how often SDG&E may call upon a customer to run its backup generator. These and other terms and conditions are specified in SDG&E's proposed tariff, which appears as Attachment B to this Petition. Do any AReM members want to support this proposal?

We're sending out this special edition e-mail to give you a jump on these new deals. Plus, in (festive) light of our new, lower Turkey Day fares and the short workweek, we decided to release our Hot Deals By E-mail today and on Wednesday of the upcoming holiday week. This will help those who want to travel home for the holidays and visit the relatives (or get away from Uncle Ed's snoring during the football game). You can take advantage of a two-day getaway that takes you where you want to go on Thanksgiving Thursday and brings you back home Friday for a restful weekend. Airfares are as low as $64 roundtrip, and just $151 roundtrip for travel up to 1,500 miles from your departing airport. Our Wednesday e-mail will also offer newly negotiated deals to 15 Caribbean cities, including Cancun, Grand Cayman, Montego Bay and St. Maarten with discounts reaching 60 percent for travel through June 15, 2001. If you're going to be traveling and unable to check your e-mail, why not ask a family member at your destination to sign up for a free Hot Deals subscription, so you can check the latest-breaking deals from their computers? Just tell them Tom Parsons will be talking turkey on low-fare travel. THANKSGIVING FARES $64 TO $189 RT THROUGHOUT 48 STATES. With airfares as low as $64 roundtrip, Thanksgiving travel is within the reach of almost everyone. If you're having the traditional family dinner at home, here's your opportunity to bring in a few more family members or friends to make the day more memorable. Or, surprise your family with a short (and sweet) visit. In some cases, you can deliver yourself for little more than what an FTD holiday bouquet would cost. A quick trip can also provide a chance for some great Friday shopping. Head to New York City for Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and check out the festive store windows. Visit the gigantic Mall of America in Minneapolis, Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or the Dallas Galleria. To qualify for these super low fares, you must depart on Thanksgiving Day and be on a return flight no later than midnight Friday, November 25. One other important plus with this special is that we can waive the standard $40 roundtrip fuel surcharge. How cheap are these two-day stay fares? How about Dallas/Fort Worth to San Diego or Los Angeles for $135 roundtrip? You can fly from Chicago to New York City, Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Atlanta for $103 roundtrip. Fly from San Francisco to Minneapolis, Oklahoma City or San Antonio for $151 roundtrip. Denver to Dallas/Fort Worth, Kansas City or Des Moines is $103 roundtrip. Washington (DC) to Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh or Charlotte is $99 roundtrip. Atlanta to Indianapolis, Louisville, Dayton or Columbus (OH) is $79 roundtrip.

He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury. Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. ! He! won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11. Chad Lewis , TE PHI - AARP Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington. Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game. Packers , DT GB - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting dutiesin Butler's absence. Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tenne! ss! ean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game. Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day. Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day. Rod Smith , WR DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear. Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Hollowman Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has byfar his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day. Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game,however, and is listed as day to day. Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason. James Jackson , RB CLE - Threesome Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from anankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value might drop greatly. Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football. Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a \"definite possibility\" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles.Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day. Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day. Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. Bert Emanuel , WR DET - AARP Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day. Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Threesome Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear. Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy team! s,! and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense. Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly. Jake Plummer , QB ARI - FreeAgent Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, whomay not have a better game this season. Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Road Rage Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB.. David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch. Lamont Warren , RB DET - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren onthird downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year. Warrick Dunn , RB TB - AARP Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic. Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout. More Updates [IMAGE] Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

        "content": " CDEAN (Non-Privileged).pst Part 2 of 3 UT Has 7 Commitments, Including At Least 3 Super Blues The Longhorns are leading the Big 12 in recruiting for the fourth straight year after racking up seven commitments in May and June. Headlining the commitments are two players who are on one or more national top 100s this year and a junior college star who was on virtually all of the national top 100s last year. The current top national 100 guys are DTs Earl Anderson, 6-3, 265, 4.8, of San Marcos, and Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, of Scottsdale, Ariz., Chaparral. Anderson, who is as explosive at the line of scrimmage of any tackle I have seen this year, committed on May 28, and Sendlein, who is so quick he plays middle linebacker on a team that is 28-0 the last two seasons, committed on June 2. The junior college star is DT Sonny Davis, 6-1, 325, 5.0, formerly of Austin Lanier and currently of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi. He signed with Texas last year, but failed to qualify academically and enrolled in a JC. He says he is ahead of schedule academically and hopes to be able to graduate in December and enroll at Texas in January so he can go through spring training Coach Mack Brown said signing defensive linemen was his No. 1 priority in this year's recruiting class, and this trio gives him a great start toward accomplishing that goal. The Longhorns' first commitment was from outstanding run blocker Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.2, of Brownwood on April 7. The commitments since my last newsletter are athlete Clint Haney, 5-11, 185, 4.27 (Nike camp time at A&M), of Smithson Valley, and QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7,of Paris North Lamar, both on June 11, and WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 167, 4.35 (Nike camp time at A&M), of Round Rock Westwood on June 14. While the more recent commitments are not as heralded as the earlier ones, they obviously were impressive at UT's summer camps. Donald Burgs, the outstanding cornerback from Houston Madison, told me last Wednesday night that Miksch was the best wide receiver at the camp that ended earlier that day . The following day, Miksch committed to the Longhorns. It also didn't hurt that Miksch ran a 4.35 40 at the A&M Nike camp and a 4.4 at the UT camp and Haney ran a 4.27 40 at the same Nike camp and a 4.4 at the Texas camp. Malone is not as much of a sleeper as the other two. He's a two-time Class 4A All-District quarterback and safety, and he was the sophomore of the year in the district both offensively and defensively. He has receivers who can catch the ball, but they don't dazzle anyone with their speed. When defensive backs aren't worried about receivers' speed, they cover them as tightly as they can, knowing that if they lose a step, it will be easy to get it back. That makes the quarterback's job a lot harder and can lead to more interceptions. But Malone completed 106 of 202 passes (52.4%) for 1,649 yards and 15 touchdowns for a 6-4 team. He had seven interceptions. He also ran for 405 yards and four touchdowns. Malone said he chose Texas over Tennessee, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa State, TCU and SMU. He said ISU, TCU and SMU had offered, and North Lamar head coach Tom Felty said Tennessee, Arkansas and Colorado coaches had told him they were preparing to offer. \"He has a great arm,\" Felty said, \"but what really makes him special is the way he sees the entire field. He can find his second and third receivers and he never just locks onto one guy.\" \"He's also a very physical player,\" Felty said. \"That's what makes him such a fine free safety, and it also helps him at quarterback because he will hang in there until the last split second to get a completion even when he knows he's going to get decked.\" Haney said he picked the Longhorns over Texas Tech and Colorado (offers) and several other schools who were recruiting him. He rushed 266 times for 1,665 yards (6.25 yards per carry) and 19 touchdowns, and also was a big threat as a receiver, catching 9 passes for 205 yards and four touchdowns for the 11-2 Rangers. He said when he committed, \"Coach Brown said they were recruiting me as a football player. He told me they want fast, athletic kids and they would find a spot for me after I get there.\" That spot probably will be wide receiver or defensive back. Smithson Valley defeated San Marcos in the Class 4A playoffs last year, and Haney said San Marcos' defensive tackle Earl Anderson, another UT pledge, \"is really fast to be so big. I broke about a 40-yard touchdown run in that game and he was right behind me most of the way. I'm glad we're going to be on the same side at Texas.\" In addition to those fast 40 times Miksch ran at the summer camps, he also blazed to a 10.53 100 meters last track season. Miksch, the son of former Longhorn WR Ronnie Miksch, a 1977-78 letterman from Needville, said Purdue, Nebraska, A&M, Notre Dame and Oklahoma were all recruiting him. He said Purdue and Nebraska coaches had invited him to their summer camps. \"I'll have to call both of them and tell them I won't be coming to their camps,\" he said. He caught 46 passes for 676 yards and five touchdowns for the 4-6 Warriors last season. When Anderson and Sendlein committed earlier, along with Davis' recommitment, it gave the Longhorns a fine start toward a great defensive line class. All three are physical players who have great quickness to go with their size and athleticism. They also all play very hard all the time. Anderson is the highest ranked Texas blue-chipper to pick a college. He is No. 3 on my 25-man \"difference-maker\" list. Sendlein is the top recruit in Arizona and, if he lived in Texas, he would be high in my top 25. Davis was No. 5 on my \"difference maker\" list last year. Anderson, who says he has grown an inch to 6-4 and now weighs 275, told me can still break 4.8 in the 40 on most days. \"I ran a 4.78 the last time I was clocked,\" he said. \"I want to stay below 4.8, so I'm watching my weight now.\" I was the first guy to give him a high ranking after seeing his incredible quickness last season. He said he picked Texas over Texas A&M, Florida State and others because UT \"has the great combination of athletics and academics that I want and it's so close that my parents won't have to spend a lot of money traveling around to see me play.\" Besides that, he said, \"I've always been a Longhorn fan.\" Sendlein comes from such a Longhorn family that his UT linebacker brother is named Austin. Their father, Robin, was a great linebacker at Texas and also played in the NFL for many years. Sendlein said he is 6-5, 275, and can run the 40 in 4.8. His Scottsdale team has gone 14-0 two straight years and his prowess as a defender is one of the main reasons for the team's success. Sendlein was being recruited by all the top schools in the Pac 10, plus Notre Dame, Nebraska, Michigan and Penn State. * * * * Another great defensive line prospect, Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, came in at 6-4 1/2 and 261 and ran a 4.8 40 at a Nike camp at LSU recently, and he also bench pressed 185 pounds 36 times. No one else at the camp was able to bench press 185 pounds more than 22 times. Pittman bench pressed 440 pounds, a tremendous achievement for a high school junior, at a recent charity fund raising event at Evangel. He is the younger brother of Cole Pittman, the former UT defensive linemen who was killed in a tragic auto accident earlier this year while returning to Texas for spring training. He is considering Texas and LSU. Chase and his father, Marc Pittman, came to one of the Longhorn camp sessions on June 6, and several other Evangel stars accompanied them, including John David Booty, a 6-2, 195-pound quarterback who might be the nation's top sophomore prospect, and another outstanding sophomore, DE Chris Bowers, 6-3, 232, 4.6. He also brought two top Evangel defensive backs who are being highly recruited from Evangel. They are Jonathan Wade, 5-10, 175, 4.3 (he ran a 10.25 100 meters in April), and Chad Johnson, 5-11, 185, 4.4. * * * * RECRUITING NOTES: Trivia Question - The speed-rushing DE Longhorn coaches and their cohors everywhere want to sign lives 550 miles or so northeast of Austin, but his grandmother and two uncles live in Austin and he took an u nofficial visit to Austin recently. Who is he? If you guessed Bryan Pickryl, 6-5, 230, 4.5, of Jenks (suburban Tulsa), Oklahoma, you are a certified recruiting junkie. Pickryl has lived in Oklahoma all his life, but his father is a UCLA grad and he says his top two schools right now are Texas and UCLA. Look for the Sooners to be a big player here, but they will have to hurry because he is planning to graduate in December and enroll in the college of his choice in January. He's the top player in Oklahoma and one of the truly great outside pass rushers in the country. . . My list on page 4 has quite a few new names because the May evaluations by college coaches produced some new top prospects. . . The Longhorns might sign as many as six or seven defensive linemen and as many as four offensive linemen in this recruiting class because the talent base is so strong in both areas. The top offensive line prospects the Horns are hustling are Justin Blaylock of Plano East, Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield and Neale Tweedie of Allen. The top defensive line hopes include tackles Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., Marco Martin of Mesquite and Joseph Edwards of Dayton and the top ends, in addition to Pittman and Pickryl, are Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Dontriel Coates of Anahuac. Coates has only played football the last two seasons, but he has great quickness and intensity. Baseball Roundup Shorstop Omar Quintanilla and pitcher Justin Simmons have been named to Collegiate Baseball's Louisville Slugger Freshmen All-American Team. This marks the first time Texas has had two freshman All-Amercians in the same year. The Longhorns were seeded third in the NCAA sub regional at Stanford in late May. They upset No. 2 seed Long Beach State, 11-2, then stunned top-seeded Stanford, 4-3, in the winner's bracket finale, but Stanford came back out of the loser's bracket to beat Texas twice on May 27. The Cardinal won the first game, 10-9, in 10 innings, then took the nightcap, 4-3. Sophomore Longhorn pitcher Ray Clark took a 3-1 lead into the eighth inning in the second game, but sloppy fielding and mental miscues gave Stanford three extra outs and the Cardinal scored three times. Stanford went on to win a regional and made the finals of the College World Series last week before losing to Miami. The Longhorns will lose Gerrit Simpson and Albert Montes, their top two pitchers. Both were drafted and plan to sign. They also lost one of their top recruits, Houston Bellaire catcher James Sweeney, to the pros. Vincent Sinisi, the slugger from The Woodlands who was the Horns' top signee last year, has transferred to Rice. He has had persistent problems with a rib injury.
