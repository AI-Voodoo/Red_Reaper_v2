I touched base with Susan Helton, who touched base with you and we were instructed to talk to legal (Jeff Hodge) and to Regulatory Affairs (Rick Shapiro), and so I did. They both listened to our 2002 business plan, and revised our numbers. The cost allocation for Outside Legal that Jeff Hodge (and Mark Haediecke) are proposing for Enron de Mexico, for 2002 is $133,000 USD. The cost allocation for Regulatory Affairs for the same period, proposed by Rick Shapiro, is $250,000. I hope this is OK with you, but please do not hesitate to give me a call at your convenience. Best regards. Jaime Williams 011-52-8-152-2403 ",

We find ourselves both excited and discouraged and have a number of things to share with you. There have been some encouraging developments - the ISO approved the SVMG proposal for an early notification system and are working on implementation, which is expected by June 13. This is something our committee plainly expressed as necessary for business to survive through this crisis and is something the SVMG advocated for on behalf of its members for the past month or so. Also, the first SVMG-NRDC joint energy webcast conducted last week was a success. Leslie Hummel will be available to provide feedback and discuss next steps. There are also a few things that make us very concerned. Such as a proposal from Speaker Hertzberg that has potential to severely raise rates for the business class. We need your help in devising an energy plan and a strategy by which we can adress proposals such as this one. We also need to hear from you in devising a long range plan for the energy committee as we re-tool the focus and tactics of the SVMG on energy. Please review the agenda.

Enron's local PA attorney, Kevin Moody of Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen LLP, notified us that he has taken the lead for a group of natural gas suppliers to challenge the assessments and inquired if Enron wanted to be a part of the group. The group includes IOGA (an association of oil & gas suppliers in PA), TXU, Hess, New Power, and 4 others.Moody successfully got a postponement of the payments until Oct 16. EES is included in the postponement at this time. The options are to litigate the assessment (Moody feels we are on solid ground to prevail) or to negotiate a settlement with the PUC where we agree to some assessment to be determined. Litigating the assessment could cost about $50K - $60K (in additionto the $25K to date) whereas settling would obviously be less expensive initially but would provide an assessment for each year going forward. Moodyid meeting with the PA PUC this Friday to determine what would be the bestway to proceed (he is hoping to convince them that the statute is quite clear that they cannot make the assessment and that they withdraw it).

WASHINGTON -- If you talk to economists, many will say President Bush is on solid ground in opposing caps on soaring electricity prices in California and elsewhere. But if you talk to voters, many will suggest he has political problems. And now that Democrats control the U.S. Senate, they are poised to make those problems a lot worse. Mr. Bush got a taste of what is coming in his widely touted showdown with California Gov. Gray Davis in Los Angeles this week. The Republican president repeated his familiar argument that capping wholesale electricity prices would do nothing to curb demand or increase the supply of power for California. But the Democrats' Mr. Davis, fortified by polls showing that 70% of Californians favor price caps, managed to get equal billing during Mr. Bush's visit for his argument that they are needed to keep the state from slipping into recession and threatening the national economy in the process. Because Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party last week and changed control of the Senate, Democrats now have a more effective national platform to press the same arguments -- and to threaten Mr. Bush's political standing beyond the already hostile turf of California. The incoming chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, says he plans to move soon on legislation capping prices for California and other Western states, a bill that has attracted some GOP support as well. \"I think it's clear to anybody that the prices being charged for wholesale power are excessive,\" said Sen. Bingaman, in an interview while he was heading toward California on a fact-finding mission. \"I don't believe it's going to be adequate to get us through this summer, to just continue saying that eventually supply will come into line with demand and the problems will be resolved.\" Meantime, the incoming chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, plans to investigate the role of oil companies in higher gas prices. \"This is the manipulation of prices, and we've got to investigate it because our people in Michigan are absolutely furious,\" Sen. Levin says. Just as Republicans once used the machinery of Congress to probe then-President Clinton's problems, Democrats see ripe opportunities for embarrassing an ex-oilman president with strong links to Texas energy-producing companies that are profiting from today's supply squeeze. During the 2000 presidential campaign, five of the major companies now supplying power to California -- Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Inc., Enron Corp., Reliant Energy Inc., and Williams Cos. -- gave some $3.6 million to Mr. Bush and the GOP, more than triple the amount donated to Democrats. Three of those companies are based in Mr. Bush's home state of Texas, which only adds to the political tensions. The Democratic offensive has the GOP worried. Price caps amount to \"terrible policy, but good politics,\" frets Republican pollster Neil Newhouse. Mr. Bush now faces \"a difficult job\" overcoming the Democratic arguments for caps, he adds, because \"control of the Senate has given them a megaphone on issues that they just didn't have before.\" That doesn't necessarily mean Mr. Bush ultimately will suffer grave damage. As congressional Republicans learned to their chagrin in battles with Mr. Clinton, the presidential bully pulpit remains the most potent weapon in American politics for framing policy debates. Even with that advantage, though, the Clinton administration found that the initial appeal of arguments on issues such as tobacco regulation and prescription drugs faded under sustained counterattack by Republicans and affected industries. And so far, polls are showing that Mr. Davis also is paying a political price in California for the crisis. Still, Mr. Davis, who faces re-election next year and may later seek the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, believes he can limit the damage by emphasizing his efforts to expand supply and spotlighting the actions of energy companies in Texas and elsewhere. On CNN's \"Larry King Live\" this week, he complained that \"money sucked out of this state\" amounts to \"a massive transfer of wealth\" from Californians to the industry. Whatever the political ramifications, they aren't limited to California. Consumers in Washington, Idaho and Montana that are serviced by the same electric grid have seen 30% increases in their utility rates. That is why Mr. Davis, with support from some GOP governors in the West, is asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose short-term wholesale price caps to help protect electricity consumers from soaring rates until new power plants approved for construction in California increase supply enough to bring prices down through market forces. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith are offering legislation to accomplish that in the committee that Mr. Bingaman now will chair. As a matter of policy, most economists probably would agree with Mr. Bush's free-market position on price caps, though that sentiment is hardly unanimous. As he met with the president this week, Mr. Davis released a letter from 10 prominent economists backing price caps as a temporary remedy for a market \"not characterized by effective competition.\" One of the signatories was Alfred Kahn, architect of airline deregulation under President Carter. But Bush economic advisers, heeding the free-market arguments that have held the high ground in regulatory policy debates since the Reagan era, insist that such caps would distort the energy market and be difficult to abandon even when market conditions turn more favorable for consumers. \"Price caps do nothing to reduce demand, and they do nothing to increase supply,\" Mr. Bush said in California this week. Mr. Davis says the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is obliged under law to assure \"just and reasonable\" prices, and he says he will sue the agency to force it to act despite the dismissal earlier this week of a similar lawsuit filed by California's Democratic legislative leaders. Whether the governor's effort succeeds, it could provide another forum in which supporters of price caps can make their case. In discovery, for instance, California attorneys may be able to get industry data on how much the wholesalers are paying to produce electricity and their real costs of delivering it. Such transactions are drawing attention because of the significantly higher prices being charged in California compared with other states. This week, for instance, the price of a million British Thermal Units of natural gas in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico was $2.80, said one economist for the Senate Energy Committee. But when that gas arrived at the Southern California border, she said, the price was $10.20 per million BTUs. Mr. Bush himself voiced concern about such differentials in his meeting with Mr. Davis, and ordered the FERC to step up monitoring for price gouging. He has designated Pat Wood, a recent FERC appointee who headed the Texas Public Utilities Commission during his governorship, as the administration's lead liaison to California. Mr. Wood, in fact, could end up an increasingly important player as the crisis in California and other Western states plays out this summer. Mr. Wood, who supported some price caps in Texas, is considered more flexible on the issue than is FERC's current chairman, free-market champion Curtis Hebert. During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Wood said it may be too late for price caps because the commission would need months to study materials and determine an appropriate market rate. If the administration continues resisting caps, Democrats vow to score political points heading into the 2002 congressional elections. \"Bush is the individual who ginned this up into a crisis\" by frequently calling attention to the nation's energy problems, says Jim Jordan, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \"Yet the administration won't consider any serious short-term action to alleviate the problem for the public.\" --- Energy Problems?

RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ TIMES STAFF WRITERS 06/01/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company California officials are probing a vast private network of electricity trading floors suspected of being a central culprit in California's spiraling energy prices. A special state Senate panel investigating alleged manipulation of the energy market is zeroing in on hundreds of thousands of secretive transactions each year that help determine whether California will have the power it needs--and what it will have to pay to get it. Those activities also are central to a lawsuit by the San Francisco city attorney, who has accused power companies of using unfair business practices to reap huge profits from the state's volatile and vulnerable energy market. A single electron may be traded nearly a dozen times, often at escalating prices, before reaching California. By then, the actual cost of producing the electricity may have no relation to its price. Unlike other commodity and stock exchanges, the frenzied daily activity on the energy trading floors escape any independent oversight, which critics contend makes the operations ripe for collusion and price-fixing. \"They're playing the California power game,\" said attorney Michael Aguirre, a former federal prosecutor now suing power companies on behalf of Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. \"The trading is the epicenter of the whole enchilada. They trade and inflate the value.\" Power company representatives say their trading floors operate legally and ethically. \"I don't think there has ever been the slightest shred of evidence [of] something illicit or wrongdoing,\" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry trade group. Ackerman and players in the market say prices are not always ratcheted up through the trading. Often, they say, traders can match supply and demand to help stabilize prices through daily transactions and long-term contracts. Still, Aguirre and others say, these sophisticated trading operations have outmaneuvered bureaucrats at Cal-ISO and the state Department of Water Resources, the agencies responsible for buying billions of dollars worth of power over the past several months. The sprawling trading floors, scattered across the country, are marvels of high technology. Amid banks of computers and huge wall screens that track weather, electricity prices and demand across vast regions, mathematicians, meteorologists and rows of gung-ho traders try to optimize profits buying and selling one of the world's most volatile commodities. \"These are trading floors that are well outside any regulatory format,\" state Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Thursday. \"What impact do these trading floors have on the situation in California?\" Plant Operations Also Scrutinized Although trading floors are an important focus of state authorities, the probes of the power companies include an array of issues. Investigators are digging into the operations of power plants to determine whether unnecessary shutdowns have been used to tighten supplies and hike prices. Dunn, a onetime consumer attorney, is heading the Senate investigation panel that is trying to unravel these issues and the role of the trading floors, operated by the nation's largest power marketers: Enron, Mirant, Duke Energy, Dynegy Inc., Williams Cos. and Reliant. The committee is seeking records that could determine whether the power companies have swapped information on trading tactics to maximize prices. Among dozens of categories of documents Dunn's committee has requested--and may ultimately subpoena--are computer records from trading floors, recordings of communications between traders for different companies and training manuals for traders. \"We know one product of that trading is it drives up the price. . . . What are you trading for, other than to drive up the price?\" Dunn said in a recent interview. His committee, which has yet to uncover any wrongdoing, is battling with the power companies to obtain information the firms insist is confidential. San Francisco City Atty. Louise H. Renne also is focusing on trading-floor activity. \"That is a central concern of ours,\" said Owen Clements, Renne's chief of special litigation. Clements suspects power traders may be \"churning\" megawatts through repeated sales and boosting prices. \"If everyone passes it around and makes a profit, and the ratepayer and the state of California are stuck with the bill . . . that certainly looks like an unfair business practice,\" he said. A spokesman for Houston-based Enron, which operates one of the busiest trading operations, said critics misunderstand the energy market, where profits are not necessarily tied to high prices. \"We're agnostic about the direction of prices,\" Mark Palmer said. \"We make money one way or the other.\" He said the trick is in having a diversified portfolio--and offering unique risk services--to absorb the changing market. Palmer said those implying misconduct on the trading floors are \"100% politically motivated. . . . These are folks who want to return California to [power] regulation.\" Still, some industry officials acknowledge that some additional oversight of trading floors may be needed. Ackerman, of the power trading association, said his members have asked federal regulators to consider an auditing program to review trading activities. \"If people don't have confidence in trading floors,\" Ackerman said, \"that's a problem.\" * Times staff writer Miguel Bustillo contributed to this story.

World Stock Markets Companies Rush to Purchase Their Indian Units, Boosting Share Prices of Concerns With Foreign Ties By Jesse Pesta Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 06/01/2001 The Wall Street Journal C11 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW DELHI -- Foreign companies are on a shopping spree in India's stock market, buying up their own affiliates and hoping to take them private. In recent weeks, companies ranging from Otis Elevator Co. and Carrier Corp., both of Farmington, Conn., to Hoganas AB of Sweden, a player in the global iron-powder business, have made open offers for the shares of their Indian units, sometimes at prices that suggest they consider themselves a bargain. Boston chemicals maker Cabot Corp. offered 100 rupees ($2.13) a share for Cabot India Ltd. at a time when it was trading around 55 rupees. Royal Philips Holland has offered to buy the 17% of light-bulb maker Punjab Anand Lamp Industries it doesn't already own, according to Punjab. Otis and Carrier, which are units of United Technologies Corp., Hartford, Conn., have offered to buy all shares outstanding of their Indian affiliates, Otis Elevator Co. (India) Ltd. and Carrier Aircon Ltd. The price for Carrier shares was a nearly 100% premium to the stock's price prior to the offer. The buybacks have triggered a surge in the stocks of other companies with a foreign pedigree. Companies including Rayban Sun Optics India Ltd. (a unit of Bausch & Lomb Inc., Rochester, N.Y.) and Philips India Ltd. (a unit of Royal Philips Holland) have seen share prices rise as much as 40% or more since the mid-May offers for Otis and Carrier, which were two of the early ones in the current wave. Both Rayban and Philips India deny open offers are planned. In any case, Philips already boosted ownership in its Philips India unit to 83% from 51% late last year. In contrast to the surging shares of multinationals since mid-May, the Bombay Sensitive Index has risen only 1.56%. It closed yesterday at 3631.91, down 30.13. The trend has several drivers. For one thing, Indian stocks remain battered after a rash of big market scandals earlier this year. Meantime, taking a company private means it no longer is required to share as much information about its business either with the market or a local partner. \"In tough times it will safeguard your interest,\" says Jignesh Shah, strategist at Ask-RJ Investment Management in Bombay. But most significantly, India has slowly made it easier in recent years for foreigners to invest. Indeed, the buyback trend contrasts with the feud between Dabhol Power Co. and its customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, over unpaid electricity bills. Dabhol, which is 65%-owned by Houston's Enron Corp., is India's largest foreign investment and an emblem of the difficulties foreign companies have encountered through the years. But the buyback trend \"works against the story of negative foreign-investment environment\" in India, one analyst notes. As a rule, the companies play down the importance of stock price. Hoganas's buyback for instance reflects the company's global strategy, but reflects as well on a liberalizing India: Everywhere else in the world Hoganas owns 100% of its subsidiaries, even Japan and China, says Virendra Sud, managing director. But India didn't allow full foreign ownership 15 years ago, when the company came here, he says, or else \"we would have done it then.\" It's purely coincidental that the buyback comes just as the stock market \"has sort of hit rock bottom,\" he says. Otis attributes its buyback partly to India's growing appetite for more sophisticated elevators, which means transferring advanced designs here. Technology transfer heightens the need for closer cooperation with the parent, says Managing Director Ashok Malhotra. But the company's reason for going public in the first place sheds light on the regulatory cycle playing out today in India. In the 1970s, India went through a phase of requiring foreign companies to be part locally owned, so Otis made the public offer that it is trying to undo today. \"You have to work under the rules of the time,\" Mr. Malhotra says. --- Yesterday's Market Activity Nasdaq's losses overnight pressured markets throughout Asia as Tokyo blue chips tumbled 1.7% and South Korea's benchmark index fell 2.6%.

International Exxon, Shell Poised to Win Saudi Deals --- They Appear Favored To Lead Key Projects In Coveted Gas Sector By Bhushan Bahree Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 06/01/2001 The Wall Street Journal A11 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) PARIS -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group appear poised to win coveted leadership roles this weekend in a historic reopening of Saudi Arabia's energy industry. People familiar with developments said that barring last-minute upsets, Exxon, the world's largest publicly owned oil company, will be named operator of the largest opening being offered by the Saudis, the South Ghawar natural-gas project that will require investment of $15 billion and is named after the world's largest oil field, in the country's eastern province. But, they cautioned, because Shell has been competing hotly for South Ghawar, nothing can be taken for granted until the Saudis officially name the winners and sign memorandums of understanding on Sunday. As of late last night, Shell, the second largest company, was expected to win the second prize: leadership of the Shaybah gas project, which requires investment of $5 billion and is named after a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's remote Empty Quarter, a southeastern desert region. Saudi Arabia already has named Exxon leader of the third and last gas project opened to foreign investment, the Red Sea project that requires investment of as much as $5 billion. Saudi Arabia's energy industry was nationalized in the 1970s, but over the past two years has been reopened to foreign investment, prompting a fierce contest among the world's largest oil companies. The people familiar with developments cautioned that until the choices have been endorsed by an 11-member ministerial committee headed by Saudi foreign minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and given the final nod by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, they couldn't be considered final. The people said the ministerial committee met late yesterday ahead of a formal signing ceremony planned for Sunday in Jeddah, the Saudi city on the Red Sea coast. Such is the importance of getting into Saudi Arabia that the chief executives of the eight companies chosen to participate in the gas projects are flying to Jeddah to sign the memorandums, a prelude to negotiations about fiscal and other terms. Final agreements aren't expected until year's end at the earliest. Officials of Exxon, Shell and the Saudi government declined to comment on the choices made by the kingdom, which has the world's largest crude reserves and is fifth in the natural-gas reserves after Russia, Iran, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. A leadership role -- or operatorship in industry parlance -- brings the opportunity to set the pace of the project and create local networks that can prove valuable for future projects. The kingdom still isn't allowing foreign companies into its crude-oil business, which is run by the state-owned Saudi Aramco, but foreign oil companies hope they eventually will be allowed into that sector, too. Indeed, Aramco is expected to participate in the gas projects opened to foreigners, with voting rights that have yet to be determined. The projects are wide-ranging and encompass a long chain from exploration and production of natural gas, to its transportation and use to generate electricity and in water desalination plants. Last month, Saudi Arabia named eight foreign companies, from a list of 11, to take part in three consortiums for these projects. Besides Exxon and Shell, they are BP PLC, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc., Phillips Petroleum Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Enron Corp. The three companies that sought but failed to get a place are Chevron Corp., ENI SpA, and Marathon Oil Canada Inc. Industry officials say the competition was some of the fiercest ever. Said a senior industry executive: \"Everybody is looking 10 years down the road, and the place to be is in Saudi Arabia.\" Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. NEW PACKAGE TO RESOLVE DPC, INDIA'S MSEB SITUATION: OFFICIAL 06/01/2001 Asia Pulse (c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd. NEW DELHI, Jun 1 Asia Pulse - A new package 'acceptable to all' is being evolved to resolve the seven-month old wrangle between Enron promoted Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over the issue of cost of power and payment of bills, A V Gokak, the federal government's representative in Maharashtra's negotiation committee said today. \"Things are moving in the right direction and government is serious to resolve the crisis,\" Gokak told PTI after a meeting with the Finance Minister, Yashwant Sinha, here. Gokak said none of the parties to the dispute are in favour of closure of the $3 billion project. Earlier, the Indian government had asked Central Electricity Authority (CEA) to explore possibility of selling the DPC power to deficient states. But the Power Minister, Suresh Prabhu, had ruled out possibility of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) lifting DPC power. Prabhu had stated that the government would make all efforts to settle the matter in consultation with the stake holders. Asked if any time frame has been set to break the impasse, Gokak said \"delay is in nobody's interest, but there are no readymade solutions.\" The negotiating committee, headed by Madhav Godbole, has held two rounds of negotiations with the last round held earlier this week being termed \"positive\" by both DPC and the MSEB. Gokak is believed to have put forward alternative solutions in resolving the crisis. (PTI) MYB 01-06 2030 Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. GLOBAL INVESTING: Betting on better times for utilities Financial Times; Jun 1, 2001 By JOHN DIZARD The share price of one large electron-pushing company is up nearly 70 per cent this year, but could be in line for another pop to the upside. That may sound like a report from Mary Meeker, the formerly omniscient internet stock guru, or like your broker's stock-of-the-week pitch. Well, neither will be making such a claim at the moment - their legal departments have them on too tight a leash. And the stock I have in mind is not a technology stock in the sense of a silicon basher or programmer farm. It is Edison International, the California electric power holding company, whose Southern California Edison utility has been very publicly hovering at the edge of bankruptcy for several months. The day after President George W. Bush made his \"You're on your own, California\" speech, Edison's share price dropped more than 5 per cent. And while the year-to-date rise, from Dollars 6.25 to Dollars 10.50 this week, has been impressive, share-holders have seen a 46 per cent loss year on year. So why should anyone be optimistic about the chances for the common shareholders in the holding company? Essentially because the state legislators are being terrified into coming up with a bail-out plan - not exactly the plan of Gray Davis, the governor of California, but one that will preserve some value for the holding company shareholders and give them a more predictable future. By now every one knows that the California utilities were squeezed by fixed retail rates and rising wholesale costs. Edison has said it has Dollars 3.5bn in \"undercollected\" wholesale power purchase costs. The state of California (and its taxpayers) stepped in to buy power when the utilities ran out of borrowing capacity in January. PG&E, the other big investor-owned utility, filed for Chapter 11 protection back in April. Edison held off from filing, preferring to try to get a state government bail-out. Much is missing from the standard account. For example, consumer groups believe there is a lot of padding in the \"undercollect\", and that the holding company should cough up billions in assets paid for with dividends supplied by the SCE subsidiary. Many of the California public believe that the merchant generators such as Duke Energy and Enron should pay back overcharges rather than get any back bills paid. And yet the legislative tide is turning in Edison's favour. Within the next couple of weeks, I expect the Democrats - who control both the state Assembly and Senate - to come up with a bail-out plan for Edison that has a good chance of passing both houses and being signed into law by the governor. The reason is the the distinction they have begun to make between ratepayers and taxpayers. To a legislator, tax payments, as distinct from utility rates, are things that run through their hands and go to favoured programmes. Taking over the payment of electric wholesale costs did not look too scary back in January, when Governor Davis said it would go on for a few weeks and be easily covered with the cash on hand. Well, the state has paid out nearly Dollars 8bn and its cash reserves will be under increasing pressure until a Dollars 12bn-Dollars 13bn bond issue can be floated some time after August 15. A decline in tax receipts is putting even greater stress on the state government's resources. So the legislators want to get as far out of the power business as they can, as fast as they can. That means saving Southern California Edison from Chapter 11. The deal being negotiated within the Democratic leadership looks something like this. The state will make a large loan, call it Dollars 1bn, against the security of Edison's transmission system, to be repaid either through a sale of the system to the state or a deduction from the allowed return on the towers and wires. The holding company will pay out about Dollars 400m to prop up the subsidiary. The rest of the undercollect will be paid for by a \"dedicated rate component\", or charge to ratepayers - mostly commercial, industrial and large users - that cannot be revoked by the Public Utility Commission. The generators can get 70 cents on the dollar for their back bills right away, or they can litigate forever. There are a few details that lawyers will quibble over, such as the constitutionality of retroactively raising rates. And some may ask if it is not cheaper just to let Edison go into Chapter 11, because even with the plan it will not be able to take the state's place as a wholesale buyer at any time soon. But I would bet on its passing anyway. And that would be good news for Edison International shareholders, since they will have held on to most of the holding company's assets, and still have an ongoing business in the subsidiary. Don't bet the rent money on it, but it looks closer to me than a comeback in spending on semiconductors. Maybe the children's college money - if you lose it, they should work harder anyway. Copyright: The Financial Times Limited INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY, MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA: Hopefuls await details of Saudi gas deal Financial Times; Jun 1, 2001 By ROBIN ALLEN and MATTHEW JONES ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell are the favourites to lead two of Saudi Arabia's multi-billion dollar upstream gas projects to be opened to foreign companies, according to industry observers in the Middle East. A committee of Saudi ministers responsible for the developments was due to meet late last night. The companies are expected to learn the size of their stakes either late today or early tomorrow, an official close to the projects said. Saudi Arabia, which has excluded foreign companies in upstream operations since 1975, last month announced the selection of eight oil groups to participate in three gas projects requiring initial investment of around Dollars 25bn. Exxon has already been appointed leader of Core Venture 2, on the Red Sea coast, which also includes Occidental Petroleum and Enron Corp of the US. The partners in Core Venture 3, the Shaybah development in the south-eastern quarter of the kingdom, are Shell, TotalFinaElf of France and Conoco of the US. Analysts and industry experts in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi said Exxon was expected to be named leader of South Ghawar, also known as Core Venture 1, with a 35 per cent stake. BP and Shell would each be awarded 25 per cent shares while Phillips would receive 15 per cent. Exxon was expected to be given a 70 per cent share of Core Venture 2, with the remainder split equally between Occidental and Enron. Shell was tipped to lead Core Venture 3 with 40 per cent of the project, while Total and Conoco were expected to win 30 per cent each. One analyst said there was an outside chance that BP would be awarded leadership of Core Venture 1 for political reasons. A BP official last night said the group had had no indication of the decision, but added: \"Even if we are not selected we will still have a very significant part in a huge project. The important thing is to be there.\" Additional reporting by Robin Allen in Dubai Copyright: The Financial Times Limited FITCH PLACES INDIA ON NEGATIVE RATING OUTLOOK ON FISCAL CONCERNS 06/01/2001 Asia Pulse (c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd. NEW DELHI, June 1 Asia Pulse - International ratings agency Fitch has changed the Rating Outlook on India's sovereign ratings from Stable to Negative, citing well-flagged concerns about fiscal policy, privatization and the deterioration in the foreign investment climate. Fitch currently rates the foreign and local currency obligations of India at BB+ and BBB- respectively. The negative rating outlook reflects the slow progress of the government in implementing privatization and addressing the weaknesses in public finances. The fiscal-monetary policy mix in India remains unfavorable, resulting in relatively high real interest rates and crowding out of private sector investment. Until the authorities display a concerted willingness to address fiscal imbalances, India will remain locked in a stop-go cycle of growth and the sovereign could slip into a debt trap, Fitch said in a press statement. The recent corruption scandal, involving the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition government, threatens to exacerbate these trends and slow economic reform. India's general government fiscal deficit at over 9 per cent of GDP is among the highest in the realm of rated sovereigns. Persistently high fiscal deficits have led to a build-up of the general government's debt burden, estimated to be over 60 per cent of GDP. In addition, the government has guarantees outstanding amounting to 9 per cent of GDP. Fitch reiterates the point that such guarantees, issued to back mainly infrastructure projects, are contingent liabilities of the government. This has most recently been borne out in the case of Enron, where the US power company has invoked a central government guarantee for payment arrears accumulated by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. ASIA PULSE 01-06 1609 Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Thomas E. White becomes Secretary of the Army 06/01/2001 M2 Presswire Copyright 2001 M2 Communications, Ltd. All Rights Reserved. Thomas E. White became the 18th secretary of the Army today after being nominated by President George W. Bush on May 1, 2001, and confirmed by the Senate on May 24. White expressed his gratitude to the president and the secretary of Defense for their confidence and trust in him. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 10, White identified four objectives he will pursue as secretary of the Army in support of the president and the secretary of Defense: to invest in people, to assure readiness, to transform the entire Army and to adopt sound business practices. The secretary of the Army is the U.S. Army's senior civilian, responsible by statute for all matters relating to Army manpower, personnel, reserve affairs, installations, environmental issues, weapons systems and equipment acquisition, communications and financial management. The secretary leads a work force of some one million active duty, National Guard and Army Reserve soldiers and 225,000 civilian employees. The department has an annual budget of approximately 70 billion dollars. Before his appointment as secretary of the Army, White was the vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, the Enron corporation subsidiary responsible for providing energy outsource solutions to commercial and industrial customers throughout the United States. White began his service to the nation in 1967, after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. His distinguished career as a commissioned Army officer included two tours in Vietnam and service as commander, 1st Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment; commander, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, V Corps; and executive assistant to the chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. He retired from the Army in 1990 with the rank of brigadier general.

Some light at last! 06/01/2001 The Economic Times Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM) NEW Delhis intervention in the tussle between Enron and the Maharashtra government is a welcome development. The government wants the Central Electricity Authority to find out whether electricity generated by Dabhol Power Company can be sold to states which need power badly if it cant be used by Maharashtra. This is a good idea India is seriously short of reliable, quality electricity supply. Maharashtra claims that it doesnt need even the 740 MW now generated by DPC at going rates. This creates further trouble: the lower Maharashtras offtake, the higher the unit price of DPC power. Once other power hungry states start buying up electricity from DPC, the price per kilowatt hour will fall sharply. The first step to getting DPC out of the hole that Enron, Maharashtra and successive Indian governments have dug it into, is to allow the utility to sell power to anyone who wants to purchase it at going rates. However, asking central utilities like the fledgling Power Trading Corporation to evacuate DPC power for sale outside Maharashtra wont solve the hassles of the sector for all time. The government should modify electricity laws to allow generating companies to sell electricity to all users immediately. An ordinance passed by New Delhi will do the trick power is a concurrent subject, with central legislation overriding states. But even if that happens, it is doubtful if there will be too many buyers for Dabhol power at its present price about Rs 4 per unit with the plant running at high capacities. If the price is to be brought down further, the deal with MSEB will have to be renegotiated. The Godbole Committee says that some financial restructuring, de-dollarising of debt and equity, and so on can bring prices down by about 30 per cent from DPCs minimum Rs 4 per unit rate today. Otherwise, as the GC points out, it will be impossible for the project to be viable at current tariffs. India desperately needs electricity to grow. For the power sector to grow, reforms are necessary at every level renegotiations, yes, but also changes in laws and the rules of the game. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Calif. investigations focus on whether out-of state wholesalers manipulated energy prices By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer 05/31/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State energy regulators say they are close to finishing probes into whether electricity wholesalers illegally aggravated the state's power squeeze. In one year, California's power crisis has raised customer rates by $5.7 billion and dumped a $13 billion bailout bill on taxpayers. State officials hope to recover the money if they find evidence that out-of-state wholesalers manipulated the market to illegally driving up prices. The wholesalers say they are being turned into scapegoats for a 1996 deregulation law sculpted by California lawmakers and the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. The utilities have reported a combined $8.2 billion in losses since June 2000. Two legislative committees are investigating allegations that wholesalers created artificial supply shortages that drove wholesale electricity prices as high as $1,900 per megawatt hour. Before June 2000, wholesale prices for energy sold under similar terms rarely climbed above $150 per megawatt hour. At least five lawsuits, including one filed by San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne, seek damages from wholesalers on behalf of all Californians. \"I don't think these are going to be very hard cases to make,\" said Owen Clements, chief special litigator for San Francisco. \"Even if they didn't break the letter of the law, they clearly have violated the spirit of the law.\" Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering multimillion-dollar rewards to power plant workers and energy traders who provide the state with inside information about wholesaler's decisions. \"Everyone feels like they're being ripped off. There's a lot of emotional belief that unfair things have been done, but we're still working through the case,\" said Lockyer, a Democrat who voted for the deregulation law when he served in the state Senate. The state utilities commission is inspecting power plant documents that may show whether some facilities shut down unnecessarily to diminish supply. The commission and Lockyer are investigating whether the plants then increased production to reap big profits. Power wholesalers maintain that the plants, many of which are 30 to 40 years old, shut down for legitimate equipment repairs and maintenance. \"No one in our industry cuts back on production so a competitor can make more money. It just doesn't happen, at least not on planet Earth,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade group. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission earlier this year alleged that Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams profited from the closure of two Southern California power plants owned by a business partner, Arlington, Va.-based AES Corp. Without admitting wrongdoing, Williams refunded $8 million to settle the charges. California's investigations are examining the conduct of Williams, as well as several other prominent power wholesalers, including Houston-based Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc., and Reliant Energy, Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy and Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. Cohen said the utilities commission could file a civil lawsuit against the wholesalers by the end of June. Lockyer expects to wrap up an investigation in late July at the earliest. --- On The Net: California Public Utilities Commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov California Attorney General: http://www.caag.state.ca.us http://www.enron.com http://www.reliant.com http://www.dynegy.com http://www.duke-energy.com http://www.williams.com http://www.mirant.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Dow Jones Newswires LOS ANGELES -- California lawmakers are mulling yet another set of ideas for rescuing embattled Southern California Edison, and this time businesses would be on the hook. In an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied efforts to restore the utility to solvency, legislators are now considering ways to shift the burden of financing the rescue from residential ratepayers to the state's largest businesses, aides to key state lawmakers said this week. The ideas being worked over by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Fred Keeley have yet to take shape as formal proposals. But an aide to Burton said some key lawmakers are so \"desperate\" to keep Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy court that they are willing to consider anything that will takse residential consumers out of the equation. \"The idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for deregulation in the first place, so they should be responsible for bailing out Edison,\" the aide said. \"We're looking to take the burden off of residential ratepayers.\" The premise of a plan discussed by lawmakers on a conference call Thursday is to designate Southern California Edison's largest commercial ratepayers as non-core customers. Those customers -- some 3,600 users of more than 500 kilowatt-hours a month -- would be responsible for financing the cost of power the utility must purchase or have purchased for it in the wholesale market. The non-core customers would also help the utility recoup most of its $5.5 billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills. Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market as the primary beneficiaries of the low-cost power the utilities generate themselves or have locked up in long-term contracts. Enron Pushing Access to Customers Separately, Enron Corp. (ENE) has been lobbying lawmakers for several weeks to win approval to sign power-supply contracts with Southern California Edison's largest commercial customers, leaving the utility to serve just its residential customers and small businesses, aides to Gov. Gray Davis, Messrs. Burton and Hertzberg said. An Enron executive confirmed that the company sent a four-page proposal to Mr. Hertzberg proposing that Southern California Edison's large industrial customers sign so-called direct-access contracts with Enron. Enron also has recently made a presentation about direct access to some members of the California Chamber of Commerce. Under the proposal, heavy users would be required to contract directly with companies like Enron for their power. Direct access was a key part of the state's 1996 deregulation plan, but was scrapped early this year when the state started buying wholesale power in place of the utilities. The core/non-core proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers as alternatives to a memorandum of understanding Mr. Davis struck with Edison in April. The MOU -- which doesn't vary much from an agreement in principle reached in February -- has been called dead on arrival by some lawmakers, who have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the agreement forward. State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate energy committee, said there are so many \"Plan B's\" floating around the Legislature that, \"We're going to need to hire an apiculturist.\" Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said the Davis administration is still dedicated to seeing legislation to enact the memorandum of understanding move through the Legislature, but said separating the utility's \"core and non-core\" customers would be at the forefront of new discussions. It was too early to say whether the governor would support the plan, he said. Dominic DiMare, a lobbyist with the California Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber has told the Davis administration that shifting the burden of the Southern California Edison bailout to businesses is \"a very bad idea\" that could cost the state billions of dollars in economic activity. \"This [plan] would really screw businesses,\" Mr. DiMare said. \"We just got hit with a 50 to 90% rate increase. We're dangerously close to losing our businesses to other states.\" Write to Jason Leopold at jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BROWN Associated Press Writer 05/31/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A North Carolina-based independent electric power plant developer and operator has started construction on a $490 million generating facility in DeSoto County. Cogentrix Energy Inc. will build the 800-megawatt power plant in Southaven on 40 acres next to existing TVA and Entergy electric substation facilities. The plant is the largest economic development project in the history of the north Mississippi county. The second largest project is a $150 million power plant currently being built by Duke Energy. Both are expected to be operational in 2003. The National Energy Production Corporation, a subsidiary of the Enron Corp., is serving as the engineering and construction contractor for the Congentrix project. \"It is in construction as we speak,\" Jeff Freeman, Congentrix vice president for corporate communications, said Thursday. \"NEPCO is mobilized on site and they are doing earth work. It will probably take them 24 to 27 months to get the plant in commercial operation.\" Freeman said the Charlotte, N.C., company found several reasons why building a plant in Southaven, a fast-growing city located just south of Memphis, Tenn., was a good investment. \"The first thing that we look for in any project is a basic need for the commodity that we produce, which is electricity,\" Freeman said. \"The area served by the transmission systems, TVA and Entergy, at this location provide access to areas that need electricity.\" The plant will use natural gas as fuel and will include the latest in environmental and combustion control technologies, Freeman said. Cogentrix owns all or part of 27 facilities with a capacity to generate about 7,000 megawatts in 14 states. Southaven Mayor Greg Davis said both plants will generate about $300,000 to the city, in lieu of taxes, and about $1 million each to the county school system. Davis said the plants will not employ many workers so traffic in the area will not increase. He also pointed to the positive impact of temporary jobs during construction. \"Then, road and bridge tax that they will be paying is substantial also,\" Davis said. \"So from a financial impact we will see a great return in the investment.\" --- On the Net: Congentrix: http://www.congentrix.com Duke Energy: http://www.duke-energy.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In light of your impending vacation, I wanted to do a quick follow-up check. If we could somehow, without causing an undesirable state in your organization, facilitate the ability to purchase BMC solution product for Net Works, would you support that? I have spoken with Bruce Smith, Randy Matson, and Doug Cummins in followup calls from the November 17th meeting in EB 22C1. IF Randy and Doug were likely to make a pro-BMC decision (instead of for a competitor's product), and IF there was a way to painlessly (for Net Works) enable the funds to become available to make a purchase of BMC product (by Net Works), would that be something you would support? I am searching for a way to help EBS without impacting Net Works in any negative way...but ultimately, I will abide whatever you demand here.

        "content": "Merchanting Metals update Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business. Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility (\"OBSF\") which commenced two weeks before the year end. The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit. The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF. The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ). The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave. The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues. Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet. The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers. The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1. Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses. An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads. User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF. A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source documentation within Enron Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders ) Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices/request for payment ) A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April If you have any questions please call me on x34703 Regards Mike ",

        "content": "California Update 07.18.01 The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling. In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two \"informational\" hearings that \"this is it,\" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the \"July 12\" date changed to \"the effective date of the bill\" or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a \"fair\" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting. That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short, little has changed since yesterday. Best, Jeff ",

Washington, June 5 (Bloomberg) -- President George W. Bush delivered his energy plan to Senator Frank Murkowski last month, expecting the Alaska Republican to push it more or less intact through the Senate and on to passage by the House. Now the package intended to boost oil and gas production and ease some pollution controls is in the hands of Jeff Bingaman. The New Mexico Democrat disagrees with Bush's approach and wants to start fresh negotiations on what U.S. policy should be. Bingaman, 57, who's spent most of his 19 years in the Senate out of the spotlight, will become chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee when Democrats take control of the Senate later this week. Bush wants to make it easier for companies like Enron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, to build power plants and pipelines by easing regulations, and he's opposed to regulating the carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming. Bingaman has introduced legislation to cut emissions to curb global warming. The president's proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, in trouble even with Republicans in charge, is dead as long as Democrats have control. Bingaman has no plans to consider it. Bush opposes caps on energy prices; Bingaman is cosponsor of legislation to impose caps on wholesale energy prices in California although, according to a spokesman, he'd prefer the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do that on its own. Seeking Consensus Bingaman says rather than offer his own plan now, he'll try to sit down with Republicans and negotiate something both sides can agree on. There is already agreement on some proposals, such offering tax credits to encourage domestic drilling and the use by business of renewable energy technology, such as wind-powered turbines. ``Obviously, I'm going to work for consensus,'' he said. ``There's nothing about much of these issues that should be partisan.'' Bingaman says he hasn't decided whether to push a single, comprehensive energy bill or move issues separately. Democrats may insist on separate bills for political purposes, said Tim Evans, a senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus. ``They'll say, `Let's get all of the most vulnerable Republicans on record supporting drilling and see if they get re- elected,''' he said. Whatever his decision, Bingaman won't meet Murkowski's goal to have a bill for Bush to sign on July 4. ``I'm not anxious to have some artificial deadline so that we can have a bill-signing ceremony on a holiday,'' Bingaman said. ``I don't think that's the way to legislate.'' Visionary or Do-Nothing? Throughout his career, Bingaman has made a practice of taking time to study an issue before acting. ``He's something of a visionary,'' said Bruce Black, a former law partner who became a federal judge in New Mexico after Bingaman recommended his nomination. ``He sees trends.'' Opponents see inaction. ``He doesn't accumulate much in the way of negatives by not doing much,'' said John Dendahl, chairman of the Republican Party of New Mexico. Bingaman is a politician who doesn't stray from party positions, Dendahl said. ``He's not a maverick. He's always been when the chips are down a straight Democratic voter.'' In 2000, Bingaman voted with the party leadership 87 percent of the time on votes in which the two parties took opposing positions, according to data compiled by Congressional Quarterly. Fundraising Success In the Senate, Bingaman's strategy has been to home in on issues that have been neglected, such as school accountability and defense research that has civilian uses, work with others, and not hog the credit. ``He wouldn't try to beat it to the front of the class,'' said Ben Alexander, a Bingaman fundraiser. That approach appears to have worked: Republicans haven't been able to budge Bingaman from his Senate seat by appealing to New Mexicans' distrust of party-line politicians. With Alexander's help, Bingaman built a campaign fund that's helped him fend off rivals. He raised $2.7 million for his 2000 re- election bid compared with his Republican challenger's $669,000. The $295,527 Bingaman got from oil and gas companies and electric utilities made him the industry's sixth-largest congressional recipient in last year's elections, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The oil and gas industry gave $32.6 million overall last year in campaign contributions. The top contributor, Enron, a pipeline and energy-trading firm, gave $2.4 million. Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, followed with $1.4 million and BP, the third largest publicly traded oil company, donated $1.3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Comparison With Murkowski Environmentalists said Bingaman will balance conservation and production concerns better than Murkowski. ``Murkowski wants to jam through an agenda'' to boost production, said Alyssondra Campaigne, legislative director of the National Resources Defense Council. Bingaman ``tends to be more studious and thorough.'' As chairman, Murkowski has pushed a comprehensive bill that includes tax incentives to promote the use of alternative energy and opening 1.5 million acres of the 19-million acres of the Alaska refuge to oil and gas exploration. Bingaman has proposed leasing land in the Gulf of Mexico for oil production, and that concerns environmentalists. ``It would put too much at risk in coastal resources,'' the NRDC's Campaigne said. USA: TECO breaks ground on 599-MW Arkansas power plant. 06/05/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - TECO Energy subsidiary TECO Power Services held a groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday on its 599-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant in Dell, Ark. Actual construction on the Dell Power Station began in March, the company said in a statement. One megawatt provides enough electricity for about 1,000 average homes, therefore the Dell plant will provide enough electricity for about 600,000 homes. National Energy Production Corp. (NEPCO), a subsidiary of Houston-based energy giant Enron Corp. , is building the plant. The Dell plant, along with a sister plant, the McAdams station in Kosciusko, Miss., are designed to interconnect with the Entergy transmission system. Both will sell electricity to wholesale customers in the Southeast and Midwest, TECO said. Dell is expected to begin commercial operation in the second half of 2002. Tampa, Fla.-based TECO Energy units include Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas System, TECO Transport, TECO Coal, TECO Coalbed Methane, TECO Propane Ventures and TECO Solutions. TECO Power Services have announced projects to serve customers in 18 states, spanning the southern half of the U.S. TECO Energy has ownership in nearly 11,000 megawatts, operating, under construction or in advanced stages of development worldwide. - New York Power Desk, 646 223-6074, fax 646 223-6079, e-mail Eileen.Moustakis@reuters.com.

All Rights Reserved. UK: Intl bonds-Telecoms suffer despite positive market. 06/05/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - European telecoms firms were hit by rumours of new issuance and profit taking in the international bond markets on Tuesday while other industries enjoyed stable prices on good market sentiment. The Reuters CorpTop index and traders had telecoms spreads - the difference between the yield on corporate and similarly dated government bonds - between two and four basis points wider on Tuesday. Industrial companies and utilities, however, traded two to three basis points tighter. The fall in telecoms bonds prices was partly caused by strong indications from investment banks that Deutsche Telekom is on the verge of launching a deal for between five and 10 billion euros. \"That rumour has caused some repricing today bu we also have profit taking after a month-long rally in telecoms prices caused patly by a fall in equity volatility and partly by a feeling that the harsh part of the storm may have passed,\" said one London-based trader. Telecoms bonds have benefitted from a feeling among many investors that the immediate danger of credit rating downgrades and further bad news has now passed. \"Telecoms is a roller coaster but maybe the twists and turns are a little more gentle than they were four months ago,\" said one Paris-based trader. \"Also remember that many of these companies are household names and that attracts the retail market while the possibility of getting a heavier coupon on further downgrades attracts those out looking for risk,\" she added. A good run, however, has triggered some selling as investors look to cash in. British Telecom's 6.125 percent, February 2006 bond, for example, was trading two basis points wider on the day, traders said. Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent July 2005 issue was trading out seven basis points by 1400 GMT. Investment banks have been in talks with the German telecom giant for several months regarding a jumbo bond issue, but Deutsche Telekom's need to make coupon repayments on outstanding bonds in June and July mean an announcement is expected soon. Bankers said they expected the bond to be entirely denominated in euros as this is where the operator can achieve the best cost of funding. Deutsche Telekom issued a $14.6 billion transaction last year which was the largest corporate bond sale ever at the time. Moody's put Deutsche Telekom's A2 long-term rating on review for a possible downgrade in March while S&P placed its A-rating on review for a downgrade in February. In the primary market insurance firm Swiss Life launched a 300 million euro, 0.50 percent exchangeable bond which can be switched for shares of HSBC Holdings or Swiss Life itself. An official from lead manager Lehman Brothers said that the bond was three times oversubscribed and that a 50 million euro greenshoe - extra bonds held by the underwriter and released if there is sufficient demand - was also sold. The bond was entirely sold to European investors and all buyers where from major financial institutions, the official said. Elsewhere in the primary market the European bank for Reconstruction and Development launched a one billion euro five-year deal. It priced at 52 basis points over the 4.625 percent May 2006 U.S. Treasury. Meanwhile, Energy giant Enron sold 10 billion yen due 2004. British supermarket chain Sainsbury announced that it plans to launch a benchmark euro bond in the near future. Deutsche Bank and HSBC will lead the transaction. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Natural gas generators considered to ease electricity demand, prices 06/05/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. EUGENE, Ore. (AP) - Natural gas generators could ease demand and prices for electricity in the southern Willamette Valley, where businesses and utilities are bracing for skyrocketing rates and power shortages. The biggest proposal is a 500-megawatt power plant that Texas energy giant Enron Corp. may build on industrial property in the Coburg area, possibly on the site where Willamette Industries runs a wood products plant. By comparison, Eugene and neighboring Springfield use a total of about 450 megawatts. The rest of the proposals are for smaller operations that mostly would be connected to local businesses and mills. \"Everyone's looking for power,\" says Frank Lambe, general manager of the Emerald People's Utility District. Even if the Enron plant is built within Emerald's service territory, it doesn't mean the local utility would get any of the power. Enron, with revenues of more than $100 billion, typically sells power to the highest bidder. In fact, an Enron plant likely would require Emerald to buy another 10 megawatts of electricity on the open market to run the plant's lights, heating and other needs. Emerald board member Katherine Schacht, who represents the Coburg area, said she's concerned that the power from the Enron plant would go to California rather than helping meet local energy needs. She also said \"there are a lot of questions that need to be asked and answered\" about the plant's impact on water, air quality and other issues. The Enron plant would be similar to those now under construction in the Hermiston area and in Klamath Falls. Those plants are several stories high, emit large amounts of carbon dioxide and consume between 2,000 and 2,400 gallons of water a minute. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, isn't a regulated pollutant. Enron and the businesses considering their own generators would buy natural gas from the main north-south pipeline that runs down the Willamette Valley. The plans are only preliminary, but they illustrate growing concern about future price increases that could reach 100 percent this fall and worries that the region will suffer energy shortages for the next several years. Many businesses also see a chance to make money by generating electricity in a market with wholesale prices that have jumped over $300 a megawatt - 10 times the going rate a year ago. Enron hasn't applied for any permits for a plant in the Eugene area, nor has the company given the state an official notice that it intends to build the plant. But Enron has notified the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal power marketing agency in Portland that supplies the Northwest with half its electricity, that it is considering building the plant. If Enron does build a plant in the Eugene area, it would need a permit from the Lane Regional Air Pollution Authority to emit nitrogen oxides and any other contaminants. A large plant also would need approval from the Oregon Energy Facilities Siting Council, as well as local jurisdictions if it requires land use changes. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Houston, June 5 (Bloomberg) -- Waste Management Inc., North America's largest trash hauler, formed a pulp- and paper-trading group to help control the risk of price swings from its recycling business. The largest recycling company, Houston-based Waste Management expects trading to begin in the third quarter, the company said in a Business Wire release. It runs 190 facilities for collecting such items as paper, plastic, glass and aluminum. Trading will begin gradually as the company emphasizes management of the 4 million tons of paper it handles annually, President A. Maurice Myers said in the statement. Other companies also have begun trading in pulp and paper items such as old newspapers and corrugated containers. Enron Corp., an energy-trading and pipeline company, is applying its gas- and power-trading models to paper. It owns a newsprint mill in Garfield, New Jersey, and another in Canada.

All Rights Reserved. Announcer: June 4th, 2001. CHRIS BURY host: Rolling power blackouts, bankrupt utilities, skyrocketing electricity prices. Unidentified Man #1: It is the most volatile commodity in the world. BURY: Are power generators gouging consumers? Unidentified Woman #1: I think it's pretty appalling that the folks who sell us power can charge whatever they want. Mr. KENNETH L. LAY (Chairman, Enron): And every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price spike, it is always collusion or conspiracy or something. I mean, it always makes people feel better that way. BURY: And right in the middle, a federal agency you've probably never heard of. Mr. CURTIS HEBERT (Chairman, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission): They didn't build this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it overnight either. BURY: Tonight, Power Play, Who's to Blame for the Energy Crisis? Announcer: From ABC News, this is NIGHTLINE. Substituting for Ted Koppel and reporting from Washington, Chris Bury. BURY: California is known as the great American incubator. From hem lines to Hula-Hoops, the Golden State gives birth to trends that often spread east. That is why so many states are paying close attention to California's troubled attempt at deregulating electricity. Last week, California Governor Gray Davis asked President Bush for help in the form of a price cap on power companies. The president said no. Now Governor Davis is threatening to sue the federal agency that regulates electricity prices. More on that later. But first, the results of a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. It suggests that President Bush is developing an energy problem. When asked what they think of the president's performance on energy, a clear majority, 58 percent, say they disapprove. That's up 15 percent since Mr. Bush released his energy plan. When asked if they think the United States is heading into an energy crisis, six in 10 Americans answer yes. TEXT: ABC News POLL The Washington Post Margin of Error +-3.0% How do you rate the president's performance on energy? June 3 May 13 Disapprove 58% 43% Do you think the US is heading into an energy crisis? Yes 61% No 36% BURY: California is already there. For months now, The New York Times and the public broadcasting program \"Frontline\" have teamed up to investigate. Their collaboration, \"Blackout,\" airs tomorrow night on many PBS stations. It documents a colossal mismatch in the brand new game of buying and selling power on the open market. It's like the New York Yankees against the Toledo Mud Hens. Unidentified Woman #2: We didn't use his five because their minimum was, you know, higher than what we were willing to pay. Unidentified Man #2: I'll sell you 108 now. BURY: (VO) On one side, companies such as Enron, the Texas energy broker, trade electricity like any other commodity. A sophisticated trading operation buys and sells billions of dollars worth of energy every day. It's the largest company of its kind in the world. Unidentified Man #3: See what I'm saying? KELLY: CRS. This is Kelly. BURY: (VO) On the other side, in this converted department store in Sacramento, is California's trading team. Unidentified Man #4: This is the operations center. This is the--this is the location where we make energy purchases and fill the state of California energy requirements. BURY: (VO) Here, employees drafted from the state's water department go head-to-head with the pros from Enron and other companies. Since 1999, the cost to California has skyrocketed from $7 billion to an estimated $60 billion this year, an increase of 750 percent. And the demand for electricity, up less than 5 percent. (OC) In their documentary, reporters for The New York Times and \"Frontline\" address a fundamental question, who's to blame? Narrating this segment is \"Frontline\" correspondent Lowell Bergman. Unidentified Man #5: Our forecast reserves look like they'd be pretty thin over the peak as well. Unidentified Man #6: How much is... LOWELL BERGMAN reporting: (VO) The power industry blames the high prices on shortages brought on by California's failure to build any major power plants over the last decade, despite a booming economy. Mr. LAY: I mean, we have a supply/demand imbalance. Too much demand, too little supply in California. BERGMAN: (VO) Not everyone agrees. Consumer advocates in California accuse the generators of actually withholding supply. Ms. NETTIE HOGE (Executive Director, TURN): The idea that all of a sudden we had a supply crunch is preposterous. What happened is, all of a sudden, the new plant owners and the traders, like Mr. Lay's organization, looked at the data and figured out how to manipulate the market. As soon as that happened, the prices never went down again. If it was totally a supply problem, why would we have excess prices at 5:00 in the morning on Christmas Day when nobody but Santa is working? BERGMAN: (VO) The generators, in turn, say they shut down plants for routine winter maintenance. Mr. LAY: Every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price spike, it's always collusion or conspiracy or something. I mean, it always makes people feel better that way. BERGMAN: But you know as well as I do that the price--it's nice for a business. Mr. LAY: Yeah. BERGMAN: You're in the business of--of making money for your shareholders. Mr. LAY: Mm-hmm. BERGMAN: Right, as a company? Mr. LAY: Yeah. BERGMAN: So you would be foolish, as you said, to turn down the kind of money you could make this past winter in California. Is--isn't there a... Mr. LAY: I--I--I think you put words in my mouth out there. BERGMAN: OK. Mr. LAY: I said we--we made some money in California. We made some money across the country and around the world. I mean, and as I tell my friends in California, Enron was doing quite well before California imploded. Unidentified Man #7: So you can't blame the Enrons. I mean, they're the guys--that's--that's what they do. They try to make as much money from the money that they get invested. You blame the regulators. BERGMAN: (VO) Across the country, tucked in an out of the way building behind Union Station in Washington, DC, sits the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC. FERC's commissioners are appointed by the president and control a $250 billion energy sector critical to America's economy. With the coming of deregulation, state control over wholesale electricity rates passed to the federal government, making FERC the final arbiter of just and reasonable rates. It's a power FERC has been reluctant to use. Curt Hebert is a protege of Senator Trent Lott, who convinced President Clinton to appoint Hebert to the FERC in 1997. In January, President Bush made him the FERC chairman, and Hebert has made no bones about where he stands on free markets. Mr. HEBERT: The rules of competition govern that economies work, that choice works. It's why we're American. We inherently like choice. It's why we left the mother country. We didn't like the rules they were setting. We wanted to make our own rules. We want our own choices and we believe that works. BERGMAN: OK, but is electricity different? Mr. HEBERT: It's a transition . It takes some time. Look, they didn't build this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it overnight either. Mr. WILLIAM MASSEY (FERC Commissioner): Without some effective price control this summer, I fear for the worst. BERGMAN: (VO) William Massey is a FERC commissioner, a Democrat, who has found himself in opposition to his chairman. Unidentified Man #8: Mr. Massey, what is the nub of the disagreement that you have with Mr. Hebert? Mr. MASSEY: I think what it boils down to is a philosophical disagreement about the role of my agency in ensuring just and reasonable prices. I think it's long past time for this agency to step in and--and impose a temporary time out on the markets. Mr. HEBERT: Well, that is the problem because these people are saying temporary, but they don't mean temporary. It's kind of like the temporary rent control you have in New York. It's not temporary at all. Matter of fact, you know, in Washington, DC, we don't do temporary very well, and that's a problem. BERGMAN: (VO) In fact, late last year, after six months of unrelenting high prices in California, the FERC finally did declare California's rates unjust and unreasonable, but took no action. Governor GRAY DAVIS (Governor, California): So they found these people guilty a year ago. They just haven't agreed on the sentence. BERGMAN: Well, we talked with Curt Hebert. And we got... Gov. DAVIS: Well that's, you know. BERGMAN: That's what? Gov. DAVIS: Lots of luck. BERGMAN: What do you mean, \"Lot's of luck\"? Gov. DAVIS: Because... BERGMAN: He's the federal--he's the guy you are turning to to give you the money. Gov. DAVIS: He is the chairman of the commission. But he has not been overly sympathetic to California. He's more of an ideologue than a problem solver. BERGMAN: Well, he's saying you just want him to give you short-term relief, price caps, which won't solve the problem. Gov. DAVIS: Problems meaning fattening the balance sheet of already enormously wealthy energy companies. BURY: How much blame do the energy companies really deserve? BERGMAN: Watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, which are, to a certain extent, reflected in your electricity bill. And don't think that this couldn't happen where you are. BURY: And how much of this energy crisis did California bring upon itself? Those questions when we come back. Announcer: This is ABC News: NIGHTLINE, brought to you by... (Commercial break) BURY: Joining us from Boston, Lowell Bergman, the correspondent for tomorrow's \"Frontline\" broadcast. From our Los Angeles bureau, Laura Holson, a business correspondent for The New York Times, who's been covering the California energy crisis. And here in Washington, Joe Kahn, who reports on energy and economics for The New York Times. Laura, just before the break, we heard California Governor Davis blaming the energy companies and the federal regulators. How much of his argument is sinking in. In other words, whom do Californians blame for this? Ms. LAURA HOLSON (The New York Times): The interesting thing is Californians blame everybody for this ap--for what has happened with the energy crisis. They blame the governor for not responding quickly enough to a crisis that started, you know, a year ago, if you really, you know, look at when prices starting going up. They are angry at their utilities who they feel have failed them. They have often had very close kind of paternal relationships with their utilities and they feel that they've been cheated. And they are very angry with the power generators, in particular, who they feel are charging them just exorbitant amounts for energy. In particular, there was a company last week, a power generator that said it charged consumers, rather the utilities, 4,000, nearly $4,000 per megawatt hour, which is enough to light a thousand homes for one hour. And when they heard this, they were outraged. They just thought, you know, `How can this be? How can we get,' in their terms, kind of ripped off by power generators who are using them to make, you know, a lot of money. BURY: Joe Kahn we heard those poll numbers from this survey out tonight suggesting that President Bush has a bit of a public relations problem on energy. How is that going to affect the politics here in Washington? Mr. JOSEPH KAHN (The New York Times): Well, clearly the--President Bush and the White House are calculating that by the time people have to go to the polls to select a new president, a slew of new power plants will be online in California. Electricity prices, presumably, will come down quite a bit and their free market stance on this will not ultimately cost him at the polls. It's not as clear that Republicans in the Congress have the same commitment. This has already been a very turbulent time in Washington with the Democrats now in control of the Senate. I think you can expect to see a legislative initiative by the Democrats to introduce some kind of price caps in California. Some Republicans may sign on to that. Some have already indicated that they will. It's going to be a real knockdown political flight--fight in Washington over what the strategy ought to be. BURY: Lowell Bergman, talk a little bit about that free market activity that Joe just mentioned. We saw the clip from your documentary with the--the traders from Enron pitted against the--the buyers from California. And I must say, it really did look like a mismatch. BERGMAN: Well, in fact, some of the people at Enron told us that they welcome the day when PG&E and Southern California Edison, the regular utilities get back in the marketplace because they do feel like they've got them, if you will, outgunned. And--but I should point out to the audience, that when Laura was talking about this $3800 a megawatt hour, which was Duke Energy Company, the normal price, if you will, the standard price for a megawatt hour was around 40 or less. So the level of profit that we're talking about is what people are upset about. And the problem here is--is primarily that in a free market and the way that the marketplace in California is set up in particular, there's no limit to what could be--could be charged when you get close to that area of scarcity with electricity. Electricity truly is different and as Jeff Skillings says in our documentary, he's the CEO of Enron, it is the most volatile commodity in the world. BURY: Yet, at the same time, Joe, we are seeing electricity traded as if it were oil or soybeans or steel. I mean, how is electricity different? Mr. KAHN: Well, for economic reasons, it's different in a--in a couple of key respects. For one thing, it's an absolutely vital commodity. People aren't prepared to do without it. Moreover, electricity powers every other part of the economy. So, it's one of these sort of fundamental rights that we have. In fact, as far back as the New Deal, Franklin Roosevelt made clear that electricity was so important that it would be subject to federal legislation guaranteeing everybody in this country just and reasonable electricity prices. BURY: But just and reasonable electricity prices, Laura, do you want to pick up the question of well, who determines what's just and reasonable here? Ms. HOLSON: Well, it's very clear that President Bush believes that the market, you know, sets what's just and reasonable. And, you know, that has not been what Governor Davis has said at all. He believes that because this is a commodity that people, you know, believe is guaranteed that there should be some price cap on it. It's an interesting, if you will, situation when business and politics kind of intersect. Governor Davis said very early on that he did not want two things to happen in California. One is that the utilities would go bankrupt and the second was that rates would be raised for consumers. And he's in a very tight spot right now because those two things that he did not want to happen indeed have happened. And it only looks like it will get worse this summer when experts have said Californians can expect another 260 hours of blackouts. BURY: Laura, we have to take a break. But when we come back, we want to address the question of whether power companies are doing what just comes naturally to them. Back with our guests in a moment. (Commercial break) BURY: We're back with \"Frontline\"'s Lowell Bergman and Laura Holson and Joe Kahn of The New York Times. Joe, aren't these power companies doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing, which is maxi--maximizing profits and to get the biggest return for their shareholders? Mr. KAHN: Sure. That's their responsibility. They--they have no excuse for arbitrarily lowering the price that they could charge for electricity if the market will bear a higher price. BURY: Lowell Bergman, in your documentary, do you find any evidence that the power companies are--are gouging consumers or doing anything illegal? BERGMAN: Well, illegality, no one really has any serious evidence, although there have been lots of allegations and there's been lots of speculation about it. But we should also point out in the documentary and in The Times that some of the companies are starting to realize, it seems, that even though they are owed hundreds of millions, in some cases $500 million or more still by these bankrupt utilities, they're going to have to take a hair cut as Governor Davis describes it. They're going to have to make some bargain. And I think we may... BURY: Let me jump in there. What do you mean they're going to have to get a hair cut? BERGMAN: Well, apparently, that's Governor Davis's way of telling them that they're going to have to take less to a--less than a full dollar payment for what they are owed, and that there has to be some kind of settlement here of between the various parties, other we're not--otherwise we won't see any progress. BURY: Lowell, one of the old cliches in investigative reporting is follow the money. And much has been made of this argument that the Bush administration, accusations have been made, that the Bush administration is too cozy with the power companies and the power company regulators. What did you find in your reporting? BERGMAN: Well, we found that Vice President Cheney was very up front about it, I mean, about his relationship with Ken Lay, the head of Enron, the fact that he built a stadium for Enron when he was head of Halliburton. You know, the vice president is the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to hold presidential office in the history of the United States. So--but they are very open and up front and balance this relationship with their friends and with the people who they feel comfortable with. BURY: Laura Holson, this idea that so many Texas companies are profiting from California's misery, as it were, I suppose Californians find that particularly infuriating. Ms. HOLSON: It's funny, in the San Francisco Bay area when I was growing up near there, there was this great rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers, which is, as we all know, a football team and the Dallas Cowboys. And that seems to be replaced, if you will, with consumers in California who look at Texas gen--at, you know, a lot of the power generators, which are based in Texas, and who they feel now are just, you know, making a lot of money off them. It's--there's always been a rivalry between those two states. And now I think it's deeply personal because it's hitting consumers, or as they believe it, it's hitting them in their pocket books. BURY: Joe Kahn, how long before these new power plants are going to be coming on line? And before they do, or in the time before they do, what--what is it that the federal government can do to help California out? Mr. KAHN: Well, it--it will probably be about 18 months before sufficient new power comes online in California to start substantially changing the supply and demand equation there. And that's a very speedy pace. That's with a very expedited permit process for new plants. The governor in California has put a lot of effort into building new plats--plants quickly. BURY: So what happens between now and then? Mr. KAHN: Well, that's the question. That's the debate. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the power under the Federal Power Act, in fact some people argue it has the obligation under the Federal Power Act to ensure that just and reasonable electricity rates prevail in California at all times. It can't just selectively choose the times. And it has already found at the end of last year that rates in California are unjust and unreasonable. BURY: So what's it doing about that? Mr. KAHN: Well, it's--it's tried a variety of compromise measures so far, very limited price controls on certain kinds of electricity sales during emergency hours. So far that appears to be an insignificant contribution to reducing the overall electricity bill in California. BURY: Laura, Governor Davis is demanding wholesale price controls. President Bush has made it pretty clear that he's not going to lean that way. What options does Governor Davis have? Ms. HOLSON: You know, it's--again he's stuck in this place where it--it doesn't look like he's got any kind of real out. I mean, he can try to demand. He can demand as much as he wants from the power generators, but if the federal government doesn't step in, he really can't do anything. The interesting thing, at least I see kind of going forward, is how Californians have really adapted to a really, you know, awful situation. There's a law that's being proposed right now in California in which businesses will know months in advance whether their neighborhood is going to be impacted by a blackout so they can plan. I mean, we've almost turned into--if anybody remembers traveling through Italy during their college days, you always kind of knew when the airlines or the trains were going to go on strike because they told you a day ahead of time. And that's very much what's happening in California where they're warning people, you know, two days, an hour, you know, one day ahead of time so that they can prepare. BURY: That's a pretty dark scenario. Lowell, we just have a few seconds left, what lessons should the rest of the country take from California's crisis? BERGMAN: Well, watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, which are to a certain extent reflected in your electricity bills. And don't think that this couldn't happen where you are. And I think that the industry itself is beginning to understand that the crisis in California may, in fact, impact on the future of deregulation nationally. BURY: Lowell Bergman, Laura Holson, Joe Kahn, thank you so much for joining us tonight. BERGMAN: Thank you. Mr. KAHN: Thank you. Ms. HOLSON: Thank you. BURY: When we come back, an update on a NIGHTLINE broadcast from just over a month ago. Announcer: To receive a daily e-mail about each evening's NIGHTLINE and a preview of special broadcasts, logon to the NIGHTLINE page at abcNEWS.com. (Commercial break) BURY: In May, we profiled the case of death row inmate Johnny Paul Penry, convicted of murdering the sister of a former pro football player. Today, the Supreme Court overturned Penry's death sentence. It ruled, six to three, that the jury did not have clear instructions on how to weigh his mental retardation when it sentenced him. The court will take up the broader issue, whether executing the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment, in its next term. That's our report for tonight. I'm Chris Bury in Washington. For all of us here at ABC News, good night. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

        "content": "Entities that do not need power marketing authorization Christi- This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or municipalities and qualifying facilities (\"QFs\") must obtain power marketing authorization. The answer is no. With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act (\"FPA\") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce, \"shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific reference thereto.\" Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to have rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to state agencies and municipalities. With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most provisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilities making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file rate schedules with FERC. QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which authorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided cost. FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at market-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF status is lost.

We are trying to get back to key policy >makers mid-day on Monday. Yes, there are numerous default service auction models in operation or proposed, both in electricity and other utilities. The government of New South Wales in Australia is implementing a model similar to this. In Georgia, I think they recently had an auction to serve customers served by a gas retailer that went bust. Similar mechanisms have been used for years in the telecoms business for serving specific client bases, such as rural customers. Examples have been in Chile, and even in the U.S. (auctions for \"universal service obligations\"). We proposed a model for \"third-party\" default service standard supply for Ontario (working for Aleck Dadson of Enron Canada). This allowed the standard supply provider to meet its obligation by competitive means, including holding an auction. The idea was to provide customers hedging in a framework that allowed for competition in default service. Let me know if you want a briefing or futher info.

        "content": " dbaughm.nsf Weather Safety Tips Roadways can often become icy without warning, presenting serious hazards to motorists, so you should keep snow chains on your tires at all times. Flash flooding can be a serious threat during heavy thunderstorms; if you are at any time abruptly swept away by a raging stream or river, be prepared to take emergency action. If your community is threatened by a tornado, close all doors and windows, caulk them shut, then twitch and quiver fiercely as you hope to God you make it out of this thing alive. When driving through heavy rain, motorists should accelerate significantly to remove water from their windshield as fast as possible. Never attempt to drive through standing water if it is deeper than your car. Do not temp fate by golfing during a thunderstorm; in 1998 alone, over 14,000 golfers completely fucked up their favorite golf shoes by walking on saturated greens, and another 9,200 were injured by flying clubs whose grips had become unexpectedly slippery. Sandstorms can occur without warning in desert climates, and present serious blinding and choking hazards to people caught in them. If you find yourself caught in a sandstorm, you should immediately reconsider what hell your were doing wandering through the goddamn desert in the first place. While not necessarily weather phenomena, earthquakes can be powerful and devastating. If you fear you might be living in an earthquake-prone region, consider moving to less threatened locations, such as Antarctica or the moon. from: http://www.brknews.com/",
