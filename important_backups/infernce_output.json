Jeff will also retain his duties as president and chief operating officer. I will continue as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations. Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth. He is clearly ready for the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I'm ready for a somewhat different role. Our succession plan has been clear for some time. This has afforded Jeff and me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that continues to exceed everyone's expectations, including our own. We look forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role. There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad shifts in strategy and direction. Please join me in congratulating Jeff. I look forward to a great 2001.",

WPTF will have its attorney review the utility filings due on November 21, and prepare summary comments for WPTF as a starting point for detrrmining the WPTF position. The board agreed to hold a teleconference on November 28 to decide on its position.

By LouAnn Lofton In an effort to boost its sagging stock price, and unlock greater opportunities for the parts of its business that are growing the quickest, telecommunications company WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOM) announced restructuring plans this morning. The company, which has seen its stock tumble from a 52-week high in November 1999 of $61.33 to its current price of around $23, will create a tracking stock for its MCI business. The ticker for the new stock will be MCIT. WorldCom shareholders will receive one share of MCI for every 25 shares of WorldCom they own. The distribution of MCI stock is expected to happen by the end of the first half of 2001. Tracked under the new MCIT ticker will be WorldCom's slowest-growing divisions. The bulk of the operations that will be reflected with the tracking stock are WorldCom's long-distance and dial-up Internet services for consumers and small businesses. These parts of WorldCom's business generate about $16 billion in annual revenues. The split leaves WorldCom with the best-performing and highest-growth businesses. That includes its Internet and data businesses, its international business, and its wireless business. These divisions of WorldCom contribute annual revenues of around $23 billion, with $16 billion coming from the company's data, Internet, and international operations. WorldCom also issued earnings guidance this morning. The company said it sees fourth-quarter earnings per share coming in between $0.34 and $0.37. Analysts as polled by First Call/Thompson Financial were looking for $0.49 a share. The company pointed to \"intense pricing pressures, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the shift of consumer voice to wireless technologies\" as the reasons for the shortfall. It also lowered expectations for its next fiscal year. WorldCom's decision to split its businesses comes not long after a similar move from competitor AT&T (NYSE: T), which announced last week that it will split itself into four parts. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=177644 _________________________________________________________________ NEWS TO GO Health insurance company Aetna (NYSE: AET) announced third-quarter earnings this morning. Operating earnings, excluding onetime items, dropped to $158.1 million from $184.1 million last year. On a per-share basis, that translates into $1.10 a share, versus $1.21 a year ago. Analysts were expecting $0.90 a share. Revenues climbed 15% to $8.1 billion. In last year's third quarter, Aetna's revenues were $7.1 billion. Airborne Freight (NYSE: ABF) reported a third-quarter loss last night that was greater than had been expected. The company lost $5.5 million in the quarter, or $0.11 a share. It warned analysts in September to look for a loss of between $0.05 and $0.10 a share. Previously, analysts had expected a profit of $0.28 a share. After the September warning, the consensus estimate fell to a loss of $0.07 a share. Airborne Freight blamed high fuel costs and softness in its core domestic business for the shortfall. In last year's third quarter, Airborne Freight earned $21.6 million, or $0.44 a share. Broadband company Covered Communications (Nasdaq: COVD) acknowledged today that CEO Robert Knowling will resign. This comes just two weeks after Covad reported a wider-than-expected loss for the third quarter. The company's stock has been pounded this year, falling from a high of $66.63 to around $5 a share. Frank Marshall, one of Covad's directors, has been named interim CEO. Former chief and founder Charles McMinn will assume the role of chairman. Computer Sciences (NYSE: CSC), the information technology services company, announced that it's inked a $2.2 billion agreement with British defense contractor BAE Systems. The agreement is for six years and replaces a current agreement between the two which expires in March 2004. Under the deal, Computer Sciences will manage BAE's IT infrastructure in the United Kingdom and here in the states.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings. Sincerely, Maureen McGee",

Neither intervener (NCNG nor the Attorney General's Office) had any questions. Giselle Rankin asked if we would commit to establishing site control via a lease, or similiar, prior to transferring the option. Witness Keenan answered in the affirmative. She had no further questions. The commissioners had two questions--1) where will you connect to VEPCO's system? 2) Is this a real deal? Everyone is behind the project and getting excited as the external hurdles steadily disappear. All in all, things could not have gone much better. It was agreed at the hearing that Allyson and Giselle would file the order jointly on October 11. Allyson will prepare a draft of the order and deliver to us Friday. She, Giselle and Tom Chapman are working on the \"for any reason\" language. They had not discussed the language you submitted last week. Your language is where they will start. Allyson feels that we have such strong support from the Commissioners that we could fight the staff on the language (i.e. agree to disagree and let the Commissioners decide). Stay tuned for more action on this very hot topic..... When you get a few minutes, I would like to disucss the county's rezoning application and the Appian professional services agreement. We hope to get Appian started quickly so that we can get on the planning board and commissioners' agendas. I will be out of the office Wednesday and Thursday.

In alphabetical order these are: David Chang has moved into our group from Corporate Finance where he participated in a number of the complex financings done with several acquisitions in the Southern Cone. Previously, he worked in ECM on structured financings done by Enron Corp. as well as numerous transactional related deals. Before he joined Enron, David was with Nations Bank. Initially, David will be focusing on developing additional fixed income deals as well as working on finance origination deals generally. Arleen Duran has accepted a position in the RAC group working for Mark Ruane. Arleen has been a member of various EI groups namely, EECC, Southern Cone and Asia Pacific Finance. She has been a very positive contributor to the Financial Asset effort where she provided strong input into several of the Philippine bond investments we've pursued. Steve Flynn has accepted a position as the Assistant Treasurer, Corporate Finance for The Walt Disney Company, which has a centralized finance function responsible for all funding, equity and rating agency relationships. Steve is one of the original members in Asia Pacific Finance Origination and has been a strong contributor in starting up the group and we will miss him. Mark Peterson has joined our group from ECT where he was responsible for the mid/down stream business and oil service sector investments made by Enron Finance Corp. Most of these investments were made through Enserco, a joint venture with SCF Partners, a highly respected investment fund which focuses on the service sector. Mark will be looking to work with many of his former clients as they seek to expand their operations internationally and to also develop our downstream business with a particular focus on the resource rich areas of Southeast Asia. Nikhil Shah has been promoted to Associate in recognition of his efforts in building the investment portfolio of fixed income investments. Nikhil played a key role in the Humpuss, Subic and Advance Agro transactions which will be strong income contributors to the region this year. Ed Smida will be moving to the Caribbean Basin group working for Frank Stabler in a commercial position where he will be working to further enhance Enron's operations in that region. Enron has already met with considerable success in that region and has identified a need for additional finance origination support to more fully develop our business in that area. Please join me in congratulating David, Arleen, Steve, Mark, Nikhil, and Ed and wishing them success in their new positions. Mike",

        "content": "Reuters:FERC gives states role in RTO formation CC list suppressed... The battle to determine which form reduces cost and who's study we are to believe the Marketer's or the State's rages on...dsg FERC to give states a role in RTO formation By Chris Baltimore (Reuters) WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) U.S. federal energy regulators on Wednesday pledged to create a new body to cooperate with state officials on the planning of regional transmission grid combinations after complaints that they were left out of the process. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the country's power grid operators, has ordered utilities in the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West to combine their assets into a handful of regional transmission organizations (RTOs) by the end of the year. The agency has pushed hard to create the RTOs to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter, in which the antiquated U.S. grid prevented more power from flowing into the state. FERC commissioners acknowledged on Wednesday that some changes were needed to address criticism from state utilities regulators that they were left out of the RTO rule-making process. STATES GET SEAT AT THE TABLE FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell, a former Pennsylvania regulatory official, proposed creating a regional council that would share authority between FERC and states on setting RTO policies. Citing states' confusion about FERC's direction and inconsistent internal agency communication, Brownell, in a memo to commissioners, said the council \"can provide the necessary flexibility that we will likely need moving forward to RTO formation.\" The request was made by David Svanda, commissioner of the Michigan Public Service Commission, on behalf of six other Midwest states at FERC's workshop on RTOs last week. The move is \"a ceding of jurisdiction ... to state regulators for us to co-govern the process with them,\" FERC Chairman Pat Wood told reporters after the meeting. Wood previously headed Texas' state utility regulatory agency. Of state commissions, Wood said \"they need to be invited with a nice seat at the table, not just standing at the door taking tickets.\" COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS PROMISED FERC also promised to prepare a formal cost-benefit analysis of RTOs for states and consumers, after some states raised concerns that the costs did not justify the benefits. The agency did not say when the study would be completed. On Tuesday, the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) released its own cost-benefit study, which asserted the creation of a large Northeastern RTO could boost consumer power bills by some $90 million a year. The non-profit New York ISO would also be put out of business by a regional for-profit RTO. However, a separate study issued last month by energy firm Mirant Corp , a supporter of RTOs, concluded that a Northeastern RTO would save consumers $440 million annually. At the meeting, FERC commissioners heard staff presentations on RTO development progress in the Southeast, Northeast and Midwest. But few new details emerged on the ultimate direction FERC will take in guiding utilities. Wood said that more specifics would be available at the next meeting on Nov. 7, just a month ahead of FERC's Dec. 15 deadline for RTO membership. Under FERC's plan, the RTOs would be for-profit groups in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access, more reliable power and lower rates for consumers. ",

        "content": "Nevada Sorry for my confusion. Here's the bottom-line. Sierra and NPCo (collectively \"Sierra\") entered into a global settlement with other stakeholders in Nevada that among other things: (a) set the open access dates for various customers (the earliest of which is 10/1/00 for NPCo's largest customers); and (b) allow Sierra and NPCo to seek monthly adjustments to their rates for fuel and purchased power expenses; and (c) made various payments to Sierra for implementing restructuring; and (d) provided NPCo with a \"Base Tariff Energy Rate\" increase of about 6.5%. PUCN approval of the settlement was key to resolving the Oregon PUC's concerns with Sierra's financial stability. Nevada Governor Guinn and PUCN Chairman Soderberg met two days ago to discuss the settlements and open access dates. The day prior to this meeting the Democratic leadership of the legislature issued a joint statement condemning the settlements and restructuring. If Governor Guinn acts on restructuring or the settlements he could unwind the settlements. If the settlements are unwound, there would likely be collateral damage in Oregon. We are expecting OPUC action no later than October 24. There are also agenda meetings scheduled for September 29 and October 10. In meetings with the PUCN Commissioners yesterday, there was little if any concern that the Governor will act. However, there was substantial concern that the legislature will get in the way and that public pressure is mounting. I agree with this assessment. It is unlikely that the Governor will act without agreement from those parties (i.e., the consumer advocate and the resort association) that negotiated the settlements. Further, Sierra's right to seek monthly adjustments is statutory and (arguably) available to Sierra regardless of the rate freeze imposed by SB 438 (enacted in 1999). Nevada, however, is an odd place and odd things do happen. Further, it is beyond question that the Nevada legislature will take action on restructuring next session. Note, further, that if the legislature does take action: (a) the Governor can veto; (b) such a veto will be very, very unpopular; (c) Governor Guinn does not want to be a one session Governor; and (d) the Democrats may take control of the legislature and state--given politics in general.

Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and inspection action plan.=01; We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE(the regional electricity distributor) under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz=01; - this should cover LaPaz's electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection.=01; The only other significant consumer is a large cement plantin LaPaz.=01; We've agreed that they will slow down their operations, and provide only small, local supplies (industrial concrete demand will be shut-in). We did not send a press release on the issue, although we have received inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivians this action presented, and we are performing an inspection on the system.=01; We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time, due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz.=01; Government (VMEH, SIRESE) has agreed with the message. We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line, line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days.=01; In either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary. The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action.=01; Morales has had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina (Oruro), so we're still not sure whether this was an act against TR and/or the industry, or if it is against government.=01; Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow.=01; Their agenda is national - they've never isolated TR or our industry as a whole, although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past, probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales' stronghold.=01; The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void.=01; We're watching this situation closely.=01; The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at least the next few days - once we're comfortable with the operational situation, we'll discuss a longer-term solution.

However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 days of sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and will notify the Enron Crisis team. We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized a joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network.=01; The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply.=01; I've notified all relevant government authorities of the situation, and so far am getting support.=01; I've also asked the Embassy to look into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful. Additionally, we've shut down all non-critical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system, and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible.=01; Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano, we will continue operations, with all stations on alert.=01; We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours, as soon as our people complete the overall plan.

        "content": " PTHOMAS2 (Non-Privileged).pst 13:39 20Aug2001 RSF-ANALYSIS-Brazil energy diet slims utilities' accounts By Andrei Khalip RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The latest corporate results by Brazilian power utilities provided only a glimpse of the impact of energy rationing that started in June, but enough for analysts to say the sector is probably the most hard-hit by Brazil's economic woes. Coupled with a sharp depreciation of the real currency, which has lost about one-fourth of its dollar value so far this year, and an overall economic slowdown, power rationing should hammer energy companies further in coming months. \"Although the currency's depreciation was the main culprit of poor results in the second quarter and first half, power rationing has already shown its face,\" said Oswaldo Telles, power sector analyst with BBV Securities. \"And it will get worse for power utilities this quarter.\" The government was forced to resort to tough power rationing in June, ordering Brazilians to knock 20 percent off their usual power consumption, in order to avert crippling blackouts amid an acute power shortage. Brazil is dependent on hydroelectric plants for over 90 percent of its electricity. Two years of drought and full use of power stations' capacity to feed a growing economy dried up reservoir levels and triggered the worst energy crisis in at least 30 years in Latin America's largest country. Rationing, due to last at least until November, means lower sales and revenues for power firms, while their costs and dollar-denominated debt get inflated by the real's losses. \"It's only the beginning of rationing, but it gives us an idea of how power utilities, distributors in particular, will be affected,\" said Eduardo de la Pena of Banco Santander. \"I think we can say that they are suffering the most.\" Out of electricity sector stocks, most analysts only have a buy recommendation for Copel <CPLE3.SA> of southern Parana state, where there is no energy shortage and no rationing. GOVERNMENT HELP SOUGHT Among the big losers in the past six months were Sao Paulo's Cesp <CESP4.SA> utility whose losses rose sharply and Eletropaulo <ELPL4.SA>, controlled by US-based AES Corp. <AES.N>, which posted a net loss after a year-ago profit. Rio de Janeiro's power distributor Light <LIGH3.SA> last week posted its biggest half-year loss ever of 431 million reais ($172 million) and Light officials said the company should suffer big losses this year with revenues falling at least 10 percent due to the rationing program. The main problem for companies is that the government fixes electricity prices in Brazil -- even though most distributors had long been privatized -- and allows the adjustments to compensate for higher costs only once a year. \"This year, their costs grew so violently that when the adjustments came it was about time to adjust tariffs again,\" said Telles. \"But they just have to wait till next year. Analysts said the only bright spot may be that the government will allow companies to start adjusting tariffs twice in one year. There are rumors of such a change although analysts recognize such an unpopular measure would be difficult in the run-up to presidential elections next year. In an ironic twist, power distributors are now spending money on lawyers to defend in court the government's order for power switchoffs for quota-busters -- the measure that effectively slashes their revenues. In the meantime, the companies are banking on an obscure contractual clause, known as Annex V, that should compensate them for lost revenue due to rationing. Some have even booked that gain in the latest results, although the government has so far not confirmed that it will pay. \"Annex V is the biggest question for power firms. If there is no compensation, they are screwed,\" said another analyst.

Matt and Dave proposed the following order with respect to release functionality. Please review and let us know if anything should be in a different order. As you can imagine, (1) the UNIFY team will not be able to do everything at once AND (2) we want to start testing/using the system as soon as possible. You will, however have some influence in changing this order if you think it is appropriate. We should target things that give you and your customer the biggest bang for your buck. FYI-we will also go over this list with your managers in the demo tomorrow. 1. UNIFY sends transport contracts to KX 2. UNIFY sends psna's to KX 3. UNIFY sends upstream and downstream K# to KX 4. UNIFY receives upstream and downstream K# from KX 5. UNIFY will \"undo\" upstream and downstream K# 6. UNIFY will receive buy/sell (brokered) path instructions from KX 7. UNIFY will \"undo\" buy/sell (brokered) path instructions 8. UNIFY will receive psna's from KX 9. UNIFY will \"undo\" psna's from KX Thanks, Carrie P.S. Could we live without #2 and #3? This appears difficult to implement, and we would like to guage the cost/benefit. Without #2 and #3, UNIFY only sends KX transport contracts and receives all other data. In other words, upstreams, downstreams, and psna's would have to be entered into KX for the user to see them. They would, however, interface back to UNIFY once entered. However, if entered only in UNIFY and not in KX, then they would not show up in KX. Give us your thoughts. . . ",

        "content": " louise kitchen 2-7-02.pst Based on meetings in Washington and New York through yesterday and updates early this morning, here is what we know on the stimulus bill debate. The prominence of the is debate will increase and intensify throughout the month and is quickly shaping up to be a critical measure of post-9/11 bipartisanship and a prelude to the 2002 mid-term elections. Contact Brendan Fitzsimmons at x5-4763 for follow-up. Enron Global Markets Competitive Analysis HILL STIMULUS BILL UPDATE: 11/02/01 SUMMARY Timing: Bush wants a stimulus bill by Thanksgiving, but that is looking highly unlikely without a major (and unlikely) capitulation on the Hill; even a bill by Christmas is less likely than it was just a few days ago, meaning any rebate checks wouldn't come until well into '02; and there remains a risk that nothing is done this year Next Week - Fed and Senate: Sources report that pessimism concerning passage of fiscal stimulus increases the likelihood that Greenspan pushes for a 50bp cut on Tuesday. Expect a partisan mark-up from Baucus' Senate Fin. Committee next Tuesday or Wednesday, setting the stage for stalemate and very public political recriminations. Data Pressure: It is too early to tell whether the massive jump in unemployment rate to 5.4% will change the atmospherics surrounding this week's talks, but before the number it was clear that the extreme partisanship will delay passage and make the final cost of the package more expensive as all sides try to \"buy-in\" votes during final Conference Committee negotiations Conference Outlook: If a compromise bill is reached, expect final numbers to run higher than $100B as more of each bill gets into the final conference bill REPORT Hill and White House Bush's speech on Wednesday was the opening move in the White House's plan to pressure for a compromise stimulus bill; but WH message and the Republican chorus that followed have only provoked stronger resistance from Daschle and the Dems on core healthcare, unemployment provisions Yesterday's White House discussions with Senators Baucus and Grassley went nowhere. The White House is now refusing to meet with them prior to Senate action. Senate Finance Committee leadership is planning for a \"highly partisan\" session on Tuesday or Wednesday next week in attempt to pass the bill that Senator Baucus drafted and released last week. Bush must spend more political capital and give stimulus greater visibility, priority in order to get House and Senate compromise; expect Treasury to join the fray against Daschle warning of minimal stimulus and maximum danger for future budgets well into the future Daschle is digging-in (and with Senate Finance chair Baucus still standing loyal), buoyed by focus groups and polling showing that standing up to the House Republicans' tax-cut weighted bill is a winning message The Senate bill has several elements that are strongly rejected by the White House and the House Republicans including the extended health care facilities under COBRA. This was the key to administration attempts to find a compromise and that has now failed. Although there may be legislation passed by the Senate Finance Committee during next week's mark-up, it will be passed on an exceptionally rigid party line vote and the entrenched positions on all sides will be further reinforced. Macroeconomy Fed Tuesday: Treasury's announced plans to end 30yr bonds and today's employment report will strengthen pricing of 50bp on Tuesday and a further 25bp December 11 and will continue to direct attention back to the back and forth between the Hill and WH. After Fed meeting focus will be on O'Neill and Lindsey within the Administration Waiting on Washington: Heightened sense of immediacy as US macro data continues to confirm recession: with a $100B stimulus bill already priced in to the market, delay or failure in passing a bill could have strong negative effects. This week's raft of weak data, particularly today's confirmed weak employment report, will increase the pressure for movement on a stimulus bill",

With few exceptions the OPEN is never held this far south, thus making the event very accessible to those of us in the Dallas area. This will mark the 3rd Open to be held at SHCC. I've been asked to assist in the Corporate Hospitality for the event. Because of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the world's preeminent sporting events. To see it live , to watch the drama unfold in person, is an unforgettable moment. This is one reason why companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package. Before I put the word out in the Dallas market (and they will sell out soon) I wanted clients of MHBT to have the first shot. (I think this is a fair privilage) The tickets to the event are sold out already, so the only way to gain access is via a hospitality package. They aren't cheap but the chance to have a U.S. Open so close might never happen again. Prices are from? $28,500 to $150,000. These prices range from a table in a furnished, shared pavilion to an exclusive environment. If you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and I will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated with each option. These started to go on sale in the Tulsa marketplace recently and several options are SOLD OUT, including a few over $ 500,000. Since demand is so high and space is limited I will hold off a week before making non-MHBT clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime. Take advantage of getting your best clients into the 2001 U.S. Open. Pat ",

The new draft standard, a compromise proposal from TI, Intersil Corp. and severalother companies, combines elements from the final two independent proposals that were originally considered for the 802.11g standard. It offers compatibility with 802.11b and a set of data-rates up to 54Mbps in the 2.4GHz band. In addition, the new draft standard also contains modes of operation using PBCC-22 and CCK-OFDM. This integration of modes will enable consumer products to support multiple modulations and provides a clear bridge from 11Mbps to 54Mbps data rates. \"The IEEE has defined a clear path for 802.11g that bridges 11, 22 and 54 Mbps, making multi-mode products based on one standard a reality,\" said Allen Nogee, senior analyst Cahners In-Stat/MRD. \"By already offering 22Mbps capabilities with the ACX100, TI and its customers are well positioned to enable the first step in the deployment of 802.11gcompliant products in the 2.4GHz band.\" The 802.11g draft standard utilizes framework from the original proposals for 802.11g which called for OFDMin the 2.4GHz band as an optional mode to the primary proposed modulation,either PBCC-22 or CCK-OFDM. The 802.11g draft standard has two mandatory modes, OFDM offering 802.11a data rates in the 2.4GHz band, and implementation of 802.11b CCK for full backward compatibility. It also offers two optional modes of PBCC-22 and CCK-OFDM, to support rates up to 24Mbps. This balanced compromise offers a much clearer bridge between the 802.11a and 802.11b standards, plus is a straightforward means to develop true multi-mode/RF devices. \"TI supports the new IEEE 802.11g draft standard and commends the group for its work to reach a well-balanced compromise that offers the WLAN industry a clear path to support multiple modes within a single standard,\" said Marc Cetto, general manager Wireless Networking at TI. \"This is a positive development for customers offering or developing products based on TI's ACX100 solution providing 802.11b compliance with differentiating extended data rates via PBCC-22 now, and be confident that their solutions are fully embraced by the 802.11 standards organization.\" Now that the technology behind 802.11g has been clarified, TI will be developing 802.11g-compliant devices by using elements of its existing 802.11b solution, as well asits 802.11a work in progress, for availability in mid- 2002. Additionally,since TI's PBCC-22 is specified in the 802.11g draft, the company's existing devices, which already offer this higher rate feature, will be able to interoperate at 22Mbps with the company's 802.11g-compliant devices that will also offer PBCC-22. This ensures a high degree of forward- compatible interoperability at this higher data rate, while maintaining full 802.11b compliance. TI is currently shipping the ACX100 to customers offering 802.11b compatibility with 802.11g standards compliant 22Mbps extended data rates allowing them to quickly differentiate their products in a less confusing WLAN ecosystem. \"TI is a strong proponent of industry standards and has consistently and proactively worked with TGg to find a compromise proposal thatwould be acceptable to all the members. This effort has paid off in the creation and selection of a compelling proposal in which multiple parties canwalk away as winners, most notably, end consumers of WLAN products,\" said Bill Carney, director of business development, Wireless Networking at TI.

        "content": "Progress Vince, I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc.... Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further? The multi-language issue isn't really that much of an issue, as the current system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but I've had a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability. On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to find a common Valuation piece between the systems. I'd like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days? Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e. Seperating research domain problems from IT problems. She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that studying documentation wasn't enough. About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon. (in fact I've asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT \"working together\" document, which will identify how the exchange of information takes place. Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do all the environment setup for her, because she doesn't really want to have to do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and doesn't seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an IT issue and ask for help from research. I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely. I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their progress on Friday. In the meantime l'll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn't involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution. Regards Steve ",

I have hired a fasil (classic Ottoman music) band to serenade us at our table, etc. If all goes well (and there are lots of little hurdles to be leapt) looking at an early June wedding. Yikes! At the same time think I have found a fantastic place here on the Asian side over looking the Bosphorus. Not a sure thing, as have to make sure to minimize the many risks.
