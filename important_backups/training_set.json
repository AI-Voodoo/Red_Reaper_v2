The description will start with People\\ or Room\\ unless it was entered manually at the source. Data connections: One connection is being charged for each room instead of one connection for each port in a room. Attached are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services. EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC. For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose. People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service. EIS bills services on a one month lag. We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee. This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information. Please examine these billings for accuracy. If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative. If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\"."

This draft reflects TECO's comments, Enron's comments, and my own comments. At this stage, rather than clean up all drafting issues (and there are many), it is probably most important to focus on conceptual matters. That said, the most significant conceptual revisions from the previous draft are the addition of the Notice to Proceed concept, the addition of Conditions Precedent concept, and revamping the Milestone provisions. As for drafting matters -- the previous draft had many undefined terms, which I have now defined. Also, there were many sections with concepts repeated in other sections but stated differently and with slightly different obligations. To avoid confusion and a potential dispute as to the controlling section, I have deleted repetitive sections. (For example, Section 4.14 and 18.5 address disconnection after termination of the Agreement, but each is worded differently and has somewhat different provisions. I have deleted the old Section 4.14.). Also, I have made some clarifications to ambiguous language. There are still several open issues that we should discuss prior to providing this draft to TECO.

I felt that it would be useful to bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation. I met Melanie this morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in Houston. I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine from a career progression perspective and Houston Research's to fill an urgent need. Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, has kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations. I expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign assignment representative in the near future. I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement. The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enron Corp is too dramatic and requires me to \"burn bridges\" and my return to Enron Europe would be difficult. Also, I would lose the valuable support structures available to me in London. The amount of any fixed costs (flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they justify making the contract a three year (local) one. I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience & value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have identified & justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and an \"Excellent\" rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also \"Excellent\"), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my existing Enron Europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one-off allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).

        "content": " gnemec.nsf Steve, I have forwarded to you a copy of Exhibit \"A\". ANP will initially own the pipe and meter downstream of the interconnect valve with HPL. The meter will be located at the ANP facility. Thier intent is to gift us the pipeline after Nick builds this line and if they get financing as per their current expectations. We have had discussions with them regarding income tax gross up and methods of gifting. They will keep ownership of the meter after gifting. Obviously, we can elect to not take ownership of the pipe if that is our choice. The plant will build and own three independent interconnecting pipelines. The first is to connect HPL, a second independent line will be built to connect Tejas and the third independent lateral is to connect MidCon. The ANP fuel design is that each lateral pipeline will independently feed two of the six combustion turbines. This is a European fuel design that they are using at their Midlothian Plant located near Dallas. The Midlothian Plant commenced operations this summer. We believe that the turbine supplier, ABB, is requiring this design. None of the pipes will be interconnected in the plant upstream of the metering. Nick will also build the other two laterals. Under Article 5 we limit Chambers ability to tap or otherwise modify the HPL connecting lateral. This will protect the integrity of our delivery in case they do not gift the pipeline. Regarding operatorship of the meter, we have had numerous discussions with ANP. Lack of operatorship of the meter is a deal killer for them. I have reviewed this position with James, Ed and Brad. The fact that we have made ANP aware that we will insist upon stringent requirements within our transportation and commodity contracts regarding how they can take gas from HPL, the group is comfortable that we can handle deliveries to ANP in a manner that limits our exposure to abuse. We will also see, in our control room, the status of the delivery. Once Chambers gifts (or otherwise transfers the line to HPL) several sections of the interconnect will be modified. A key modification will be the location of the custody transfer point. Currently it is the flange off of the interconnect valve. This is for liability purposes. Afterward gifting, it will be the meter located in the plant. Let me know if you have other concerns. Thanks, Greg Brazaitis"

        "content": "New West Power Deal Info Confidential: For Internal Distribution Only The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible. I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing. My apologies for this. Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal. A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals. As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money. Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check. Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices. We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have. We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money. We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on. Here are the procedures as I understand them. If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call. Cash Desk Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated. On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money. If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point. We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location. The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome. The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail. The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current. Marketing Desk Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk. The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis. The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder. Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058. The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis. We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated. Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome. Deal Entry The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle. After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount. We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions. This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door. It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice. I'm sure that I've missed something. Let me know. Regards, Tim"

I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.

The LJM deal is called \"Blue Dog\" and ENA has decided it wants those turbines. Blue Dog- Lisa has her folks talking to WLB regarding the Blue Dog contract and Rob Taylor has contacted Winston & Strawn about a new ADA. We will need to contact GE about the transfer (actually it will be two transfers - one to WLB and then into the \"Developer\" in the CSFB structure). Who at ENA legal should I work with to get that process started? Both Rob and I have the turbine purchase agreement and can get it to the ENA lawyer. Austin - The Austin turbines are the LMs - that purchase agreement contemplates that the new buyer will execute another agreement with (GE/S&S) covering the turbines it acquires. Is that structure still contemplated? Is there another way to do this that would be easier from a labor perspective? I assume ENA will then be assigning the equipment on to the project company or EPC contractor, also.

Rob, Jordan and I have been considering this from a legal relationships perspective and request your thoughts on same. Tobias Munk of DealBench has been working on developing this DealBench/Freshfields relationship for a couple of months. Tobias came to DealBench from Enron London to help develop a capability to do due diligence on the DealBench platform (the dataroom product). He initiated contact with Freshfields (Hugh Crisp) before moving to Houston. DealBench has been aware that this relationship would be subject to approval by Enron legal management. The proposed relationship essentially is a business referral one: DealBench would pay Freshfields 10% of site license fees paid to DealBench by customers referred by Freshfields. Freshfields also would provide up to 100 hours of consulting services regarding the dataroom product for no additional monetary consideration but DealBench would give Freshfields exclusive recognition for helping DealBench develop the dataroom product in Europe and Asia. DealBench advises that Freshfields believes it would benefit from the publicity associated with being part of the development of an e-commerce product. The DealBench commercial team is very interested in moving forward with Freshfields. Although Freshfields cannot guarantee any referrals, DealBench believes the relationship would be fruitful for it commercially because of Freshfields' prominence in M&A transactions in Europe and Asia. Before DealBench moves further with Freshfields, it would like legal clearance. We look forward to hearing from you. Regards, NJD Nora J.

With significantly warm weather in November and December, fourth quarter demand has dropped considerably below expectations, and storage inventories have remained higher than projected. This has temporarily eased the upward pressure on prices, but the fundamentals remain aligned for tighter gas markets to come. In a December 14, 1999 Conference Call, CERA's North American Natural Gas Team discussed the status of the current market: ? Warm weather so far this winter released pressure in the North American gas market - this pressure has already begun to resurface. ? Winter storage and supply appear adequate, injections next summer could still challenge supply availability. ? Northeast price volatility will continue, with or without added pipeline capacity. ?

        "content": " rshapiro.nsf Colleagues: Stella Chan, Pat Keene and Harry Kingerski would like to communicate a streamlined process to provide Government and Regulatory support to URM (Utility Risk Management). The process strives to bring GA in the different regions, in Houston and URM much closer to each other to provide and implement GA service as completely, and cost-effectively as possible. The suggested process includes four steps, namely: Curve validation Process, Quantifying of Regulatory Risks/Change, Coordination of Strategy Development, and Coordination of Strategy Implementation. A description of these functions are as follows: Curve Validation Process: This process aims at reviewing, and validating, every 90 days, the regulatory inputs of: a) the largest 60 curves in Enron's books, and b) the new deals that are under approval during the review period. The curve validation process is currently in progress and GA personnel in Houston and the regions are already involved. Quantification of Regulatory Risks/Change: This process aims at quantifying--in dollars terms--the impact of the change in the regulatory inputs on a specific position. The model is now in place, and test is in progress. This process will involve initiation by GA regional personnel (also possibly by URM) with potential regulatory changes that may impact EES positions. The quantification exercise will be done jointly by URM and GA. Coordination of Strategy Development: The outcome of curve validation and quantification of regulatory risks--functions 1, and 2 above--will likely call for a group of regulatory measures and action items. The function of Stella and Pat is to coordinate and facilitate strategy sessions in association with the owner of the curve in URM, and her/his counterparts in Midwest/Midsouth, Atlantic Seaboard, the Western Region, and Texas & Oklahoma Ercot, and SPP. The strategy sessions shall come up with suggested action items, probability of success, and likely associate costs for implementation. Stella and Pat shall be responsible for seeking the buy-off, and approval, of the strategy from URM and securing the needed budget, if necessary. Coordination of Strategy Implementation: Once the strategy is approved, it shall enter the implementation stage. The role of Stella and Pat is to coordinate between URM requests/positions and their counterparts in the regions. As the case now, they shall continue supporting the regions in the implementation as needed. To facilitate these functions Stella and Pat shall emulate the coverage lines of the URM. Stella shall coordinate the Eastern Region, while Pat shall coordinate the Western Region. These regions do not follow the conventional wisdom, and need to be specifically defined. They are: Eastern Region: ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, NJ, PA, MD, DE, VA, WV, NC, SC, GA, AL, TE, KY, and FL. Western Region: The remaining states (including OH in the east). From the Regional perspective, the process will naturally be overseen by the Regional Directors (i.e., Steve, Janine, Jean, and Paul), meanwhile, Harry shall oversee it from Houston side. The process, however, is designed to give regional managers and GA in Houston as much autonomy as possible and shall make the least possible demand on the time and work load of the regional directors (usually in the final sprint for approvals). Stella, Pat, and Harry shall visit you shortly to discuss the details of the processes outlined above and listen to your comments and advise. I shall contact you to take your suggestion for the most appropriate time for you and your group. Of course, please let me know if you have any question and/or advise. Brgrds AI 713-853-3037 "

        "content": "Cuiaba Call--legal issues 1. Consent Issue: Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) reported that he met with Furnas this week. Furnas had not received EPE's letter addressing the consent issue. Furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law. Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, Electronorte. 2. Arbitration considerations: Bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador. He consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration. What concerns me, however, is his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to seek political assistance. My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at the end of which we have the option to terminate. This buys us a little time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate. I'm not sure what reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet. I am not sure what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or express waivers related to timing in this regard). I committed that we would advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with respect to arbitration/litigation. I want to make sure they understand every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own way. Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who represents them. 3. Force Majeure: Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE does not have a valid force majeure claim. Based on my reading of the contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c). However, I'm told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action. Laine Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position. Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both parties have the right to terminate. No one buys the plant and we're stuck. I'll find out the date of our last FM notice. There have been several. 4. Budget: Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week, what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out. We may want to consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it. I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it. It needs to be subject to review as we go along. 5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice. We certainly have some conflicting views. Our experience in the Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway. If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said. Who knows. Please give me your comments or just call me. I'm open to any suggestions. John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I may be unaware of with any strategic plan. Regards, Michelle "

        "content": "WTO -- E-Commerce Joe -- I had a conversation this morning with Jonathan McHale at USTR on the status of E-commerce after Seattle. McHale said that the E-commerce moratorium put in place by ministers in May 1998 was schedule to run through the Third WTO Ministerial (i.e. Seattle). Since that Ministerial was suspended (and not formally ended), the US view is that the moratorium is still in effect. As to the work done in Seattle, McHale observed that the E-commerce people had reached a fair degree of consensus on an extension of the E-commerce moratorium, a work plan to look at the applicability of the WTO's rules to E-commerce, and a commitment about not imposing unnecessary regulations on E-commerce. Since the Ministerial was suspended, that progress is in limbo, and the US and other WTO members are considering how best to proceed. I asked him about the comments attributed the EU officials that the EU would agree to an extension of the E-commerce moratorium only if other countries agreed to the EU's assertion that all E-commerce falls under the WTO services agreement (GATS). He said that the US would never agree to that, and that other countries shared the U.S. position. As to next steps, he suggested that it would be important for companies to go through the current WTO commitments and the UN's Central Product Classification (CPC) code to make sure that whatever E-commerce activities they are engaged in are covered. I mentioned the work we are doing on energy services, and he said the work in E-commerce in analogous -- we should go through and see what services already are covered, and let USTR know if we think that something we are doing is not covered and needs to be brought into the service definitions. In other words, define who we are, what barriers we face (or what areas need to be kept barrier free), and what our key issues and markets are. As Enron considers what its interests are in E-commerce, you probably will want to think both about the activities you are directly engaged in, and those activities your customers are engaged in. For example, the benefits of having the pipeline (i.e. bandwidth) unencumbered by tariffs or unnecessary regulations would be limited if the products delivered over the pipeline were subject to significant restrictions. McHale was very open, and I expect he would be pleased to meet with Enron if you wanted to get into a more detailed discussion of the issue. Regards -- Bob "

Barbara Barkovich attended for CA Large Consumers. Nader sent someone. No other consumers. One other ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego). Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The prices are quite divergent. He expresses concern at the little offered. Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers). IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so. Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now. Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate increase. Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough Enron able to take low profile. SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing could be achieved. Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed epithets at SDG&E and SCE. SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning. Out of the Room Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators. Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs. Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable resolution. Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks Judge asked everyone to consider how to \"Share the Pain\" for Thursday's meeting and said not to expect any \"win:win\" scenario. His view is that FERC is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court. His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates. Generators oppose this, I believe. Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA."

        "content": "CATS litigation Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS litigation today. This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $155-160 million. We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days. The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says. The opinion seeks to conclude \"what rational businessmen could have intended\" rather than applying the provisions of the contract. For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the \"retrospective consequences\" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable. His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract. Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective. As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field. The contract makes no reference to this requirement. Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service. Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue. As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing. Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given. Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as \"appalling\" and \"pathetic,\" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been \"stitched up\". Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse. In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years. The case has been a roller coaster ride; I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion. My telephone number is 011 44 207 783 6582. Many thanks."

GMS views a late chart as a chart that is not in their possession by COB on the 3rd working day of the month. In further discussions with the GSM employees and Gary Anderson it was confirmed that they do not have any idea how many charts were late for the December close. They also cannot produce a report reflecting when charts were received. The PGAS program can has a chart tracking feature that requires each chart to have a bar code label and that GMS read the bar code when charts are received. Use of this process for all charts and index cards would provide a report of those charts that are late. Two reports could be generated, one at COB on the third business day of each month and again as a part of the final close. This process would tell us monthly where we have issues but to date it apparently has not been used. I have requested that Gary Anderson, for January business, provide through the PGAS report or other means a report by customer of the late charts. These would be the charts that should be in the hands of GMS by the close of business on February 5. This report should provide us with an idea of where we stand in respect to the late chart issue.

As Chair Herbert said: SPP should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously. (Issues for possible rehearing are ****). ? The Commission declined to approve SPP's scope and configuration because the SPP members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to transfer operational control and the SPP/Entergy relationship remains somewhat undefined. The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Entergy and SPP must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue. o Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the SPP RTO borders. There are significant sales and purchases between SPP and SERC (and Midwest companies to a lesser extent.) o Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer control of transmission to SPP. o MOU must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an RTO, such as operational authority, ATC calculation and planning/expansion, will be met. ?

I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate. However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround. To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001. These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc. This information ties to your rollup in CS. Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO). What we are asking you to do is as follows: 1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001). Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation. Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts. You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.). 2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function. We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so. Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed. 3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function. Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate). Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons. If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910. And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3. Thank you, Steve "

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged. Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval. With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price. We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval. We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review. Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

As you know, Sally Beck has requested that I conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current pay arrangements for all Energy Operations staff. The purpose of this analysis will be to ensure that the department's current pay arrangements are in line with the competitive marketplace. Each component of pay will be examined individually and within the context of Enron's compensation philosophy (e.g., base salary, bonus, long-term incentives and total compensation). The process will begin with a series of interviews which will be conducted in two stages: Stage 1-Data Gathering: the focus of this stage will be upon gathering data around your perceptions of your group's current pay arrangements and give you the opportunity to address any of the internal and external inequities you perceive to exist. Stage 2-Job Matching: the focus of this stage will be on job matching - we will establish a mutually agreed upon time to meet and discuss which positions in our salary surveys most accurately reflect the roles and responsibilities of your staff. We will not be able to match 100 percent of your jobs to the jobs contained in the salary surveys. Non-benchmark jobs will be reviewed using a job \"slotting\" approach. To help facilitate the matching process, I will be assembling handouts containing the job descriptions taken from the relevant salary surveys which I will send to each of you in advance of our Stage 2 meeting. The intent here is to give you the opportunity to \"pre-match\" your respective jobs thereby minimizing the time required to achieve this objective during our Stage 2 meeting. It will be critical that you are comfortable with the matches that you agree to as these matches will be used when gathering relevant market data. The data will only be as good as the matches. Following the conclusion of Stage 2, I can begin gathering the market data based on the results of the job matching exercise and prepare a comparative analysis that I will be presenting to Sally Beck. I will be contacting each of you in the next few days to set up the Stage 1 interviews. I look forward to working with each of you and to the successful completion of this project.

Dean is answering the other one and will send back to you directly. * What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement? PG&E is concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer. RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement: scheduling coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc. We are also flexible re the time period and the terms of the continuing involvement. Whatever arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial. * What is status of EPC negotiations. Will they be required to engage NEPCO as the EPC contractor? Does the EPC contractor have control over the turbines? RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO. Contract has not been executed, but has been \"put on the shelf\" awaiting decision on successful bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA. Successful bidder and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement. o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO. o West LB has control of the turbines. They can be assigned either to the LLC or to ENA. (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.) If assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor. * They also questioned whether there would be any \"agricultural restrictions\"? RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes. Last week, the Kern County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period. However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision. (The Governor has until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.) The cancellation will be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson Act cancellation fee. "

(\"EES Canada\")) and Enron Canada Corp.'s mass market retail venture (Enron Direct Limited Partnership (\"Enron Direct Canada\")), I propose a simple corporate structure as follows: Enron Direct Canada's business will be set up as a subsidiary of EES Canada. This will involve: a. a general conveyance of the assets of Enron Direct Canada to its general partner, Enron Direct Canada Corp.; b. the sale of the shares of Enron Direct Canada Corp. from Enron Canada Corp. to EES Canada; and c. a services agreement whereby Enron Canada Corp. provides key services to Enron Direct Canada. By setting up Enron Direct Canada as a distinct subsidiary of EES Canada, both entities will continue to operate as they do today. As such, (i) Enron Direct Canada will continue to be operated by the staff currently in place in Calgary, but within the EES corporate structure, and (ii) EES Canada's existing business will continue to be operated as it is currently. B. Governance - I understand from Peter that a few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related \"permanent establishment\" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada Corp. would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada Corp. Accordingly, Enron Canada Corp. was re-organized with a nominee board of directors now consisting of Rob (as the senior Canadian commercial employee) and Peter (as the senior Canadian legal employee) with officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups. Following this model, Rob Milnthorp and an employee from the legal department would appear to be the appropriate directors of the EES' Canadian subsidiaries. In the short term, the Iegal employee/designee would be me; however, the new lawyer hired to work for Enron Direct Canada would assume the role. With respect to the officers, no changes are required with respect to Enron Direct Canada. With respect to EES Canada, I propose that Rob be appointed as the Chairman, President and CEO and I be appointed as Secretary for the interim. Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed on the basis of these proposals. Regards, Mark Powell "

Please refer to the original language : Reason for this email: Gain consensus on this change Business Issue : Find alternatives to the PC forfeiture penalty when an employee who has participated in the Clickathome program is involuntarily terminated due to business reorganizations. Proposed Alternative : Replace the cash forfeiture penalty with imputed income to be reported on year-end W-2. The alternative defers or removes the cash impact to the employee. Employees moving to other Enron units who currently do not participate in the program such as PGE and EFS will not be required to report the PC as imputed income as long as they remain in a wholly-owned division. New Process : Requires payroll administration Timing: Effective immediately. Question: Do you want this retroactive to program inception? Other Applications: The imputed income option could be expanded to all types of terminations. However, in doing so, would allow easier entry into the program when an employee is planning to leave the company voluntarily. No recommendation at this time to change the forfeiture penalty for these other types of separations. Please email me with your vote as Kalen is interested in enacting this change as soon as possible for the current redeployment candidates. Thanks. "

The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of each of the Facility Agreements should be amended to read as follows: \"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the \"Refund Amount\") shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4 below.\" This is the same comment I made earlier. 2.

Specifically, I would appreciate the following: 1. Please send me a copy of the CFTC no action letter that we discussed last week. 2. Please prepare a memorandum outlining the issues to be addressed in reviewing internally-generated content, e.g. (a) CTA concerns; (b) general advisor issues; (c) other general resposibilities of a publisher, such as truth, accuracy. (As I mentioned, I think it would be helpful to have some general insights from someone with a publishing background.) Additionally, are there any particular issues to be addressed with regard to content generated by an outside consultant like Cynthia Case who prepares a case study for EnronOnline containing generic advise and who also provides advisory services to third parties. As you requested, I am faxing to you a few examples of content that has been developed for Phase II to date. If you run into any red flags, please let me know at your earliest opportunity. Time is of the essence, and the text that I am sending you has already gone out to the site developer for html formatting. 3. Please review the current Legal and Privacy Information I am forwarding to you and revise to incorporate necessary modifications and/or additions. 4. Mark and I have discussed the issue of appropriate disclaimers in some length. Currently, the Legal and Privacy Information link is discretely tucked beside the copyright notice on the home page. We have asked that the home page instead include an addition at the bottom of the text referencing Legal and Privacy Information: \"Please see Legal and Privacy Information [link] for terms governing your use of the web site.\" The home page links to a page entitled \"EnronOnline Markets\", which links to various commodity \"home\" pages. On each of the EnronOnline Markets and commodity pages, we would like to add the following text as well: \"Your company should not enter into any transaction unless it fully understands the potential risks and rewards of that transaction and has independently determined that the transaction is appropriate in light of your company's objectives, experience, financial and operational resources, and other relevant circumstances. Please bear in mind that in providing this web site, Enron is acting as a potential arm's length counterparty and not as your company's adviser. For further information, please see Legal and Privacy Information [link].\" These additions to the site are pending EnronOnline approval, but I would welcome any general thoughts you may have. I am receiving 2-5 pieces of content for review, and after my review, each piece of content is forwarding to the site developer for formatting. As you can appreciate, timing is critical so that we can minimize the required reformatting. Thank you so much for your assistance! Leslie Hansen (713) 853-6121"

        "content": "Project Triple Lutz -- HR Issues with Bidder D This email summarizes my conversation on employee matters with Nancy Quigg Young, which took place yesterday. Logistics. The most significant area for the employee matters involves the logistics of the buyer hiring the employees. In the original agreement that we proposed, we would allow the buyer to interview employees, select the ones they wanted to hire, and require that the buyer keep them employed for at least 2 years. Their counter proposal was that they got to hire who they wanted, have us pay severance on all others, and they would have no obligation to keep them for any length of time. Since then, there have been discussions internally that we want all employees to go with the sale, with the buyer taking the action of severing employees (although we would fund severance costs under the Enron formula). I raised that proposal with Nancy, who is going to discuss it with her business clients. In the alternative, if the buyer selects the people it hires, and we have to eliminate the jobs for those not selected, I informed her that we would require an indemnity for claims made against us based on the selection process. Base Salary. The counteroffer made by Bidder D does not provide that the employees hired from HPL would receive at least the same base salary as they earn at Enron. This is important because a severance payment could be due if an employee does not accept a job at a lower salary. Karen appeared unwilling to agree to pay divested employees outside of the buyer's salary bands (note: paying outside of a salary band in the context of an acquisition is standard procedure, but she was acting as if it were an incredibly difficult accomplishment). She claimed that one problem lies in not knowing the exact salary for each employee at issue. We pushed back on this and offered to provide average salaries for each job level, to allow her to get comfortable with the ranges. Fran Mayes will provide this information, which may eliminate this issue. Bonus. In our proposal, we asked that the hired employees receive a total bonus payment that is at least equal to what they earned their last year at Enron. Bidder D did not provide any such guarantee. Karen said that she needed our \"bonus formula\" before she could commit to this. I explained that we have no bonus formula and that our bonuses are based on performance of the company and the individual. We previously had provided total bonus amounts for the entire group, and she could make a determination of bonus costs on a consolidated basis for her deal folks to calculate. j She said she was \"not sure if they could get there\" on the bonus issue, particularly since she thinks our bonuses will be extra high this year. I offered to discuss whether we could modify the amounts by averaging the last two years, which she thought might make it better. Unvested Equity. When I explained to her that we could not supervest unvested options, she indicated that there was a \"possibility\" that the amount could be made up in stock options of Bidder D. I think this is the \"win-win\" position, but I think it will have to be pushed. Vacation. Their vacation plan maxes out at 4 weeks; ours maxes out at 5 weeks. She thinks she may be able to propose that, for the first year the employees work for the buyer, they can use the vacation accrual from Enron, but after that, they are subject to the buyer's vacation plan. This approach is reasonable. WARN Act. There is the slight possibility of WARN Act implications, in the unlikely event that closing occurs within 60 days of signing. The WARN Act requires a company to give employees 60 days notice of a plant closing or mass layoff. This situation probably would qualify. Thus, we would have to give 60 days notice to all employees who potentially may be affected. We can pay in lieu of notice, in the event that the closing (and thus the terminations) occur sooner than 60 days after closing, but we may want to spell out who bears that cost, if it is incurred. Benefits. Other than the vacation benefit described above, it appears that Bidder D has benefits that generally are of the same nature as Enron's benefits. Thus, allowing the hired employees to participate in the buyer's benefits plans, with credit for years of service at Enron, likely would be comparable to their situations here. I expect that we will hear from Bidder D with their proposals on these issues once Fran provides Nancy with the salary data. Please let me know if you have any questions. Michelle "

As for their existing contract, we negotiated a $.15/MMBtu rate effective February 15 - October 31, 2001 on the alternate west flow, an improvement of $.11/MMBtu. In addition, we negotiated a similar east deal with alternate west flow with Astra Power LLC.

TW was able to sell 55,000 MMBtu at the border for a net revenue of $453,000. Reliant - We negotiated a San Juan Pool contract for 20,000 MMBtu/d at max rates for February 6-28. Reliant is flowing alternate out of path from San Juan to the border and scheduling 5,000 to 12,000 MMBtu/d. Incremental revenue for this could range from $42,000 to $100,000 for the month."

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for the retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter. I advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after receipt of payment. He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE about the ability to present the L/C at closing.

        "content": "Canadian Retail Jim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within Enron Canada known as Enron Direct. In addition, EES has a Canadian entity, EES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some cross-border transactions in Canada. For various reasons, it has been decided to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob Milnthorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey. There are two legal/governance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you: 1. Governance: As a result, it will be necessary to make various corporate re-organizations to EES Canada. This will include having EES Canada established as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron Direct will have, its principal Canadian office. In relation to this, I was considering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada, with two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers. A few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related \"permanent establishment\" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada. Accordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of directors consisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me (as the senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups. I was thinking of doing likewise with EES Canada. Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate records for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are Jim and an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest McNee. I am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees of EES are designated as the officers of EES Canada. Would it be appropriate to re-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has been organized, or do you have concerns? 2. Law Firm: Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confirm that our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project was \"grandfathered\" on the basis that they were \"up the learning curve\" on a number of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation issues. There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada. Although I was not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute on some gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Toronto, Ernest McNee. However, as the focus of the business initiative in Canada will, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly, if not entirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in regulatory proceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues affecting the Alberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with the licensing and contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and given my understanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been relatively limited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young continue on with this matter. I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns, and therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter. I look forward to hearing from you. Regards, Peter "

If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read, copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify the sender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system. Thank you. _______________________________________________________________ David: Here are my comments re the Agency Agreement draft sent last week: (1) Section 1.27. I would suggest replacing \"in Peoples' sole discretion\" with \"in accordance with Sections 6.1 and 6.2\". This is more consistent with the intent re changes to the Operating Statement. (2) Section 2.4. Each one of the new provisions re nominations, (a) 1,2, and 3, ends with a similar sentence: \"Peoples will confirm these requests as soon as practicable prior to such nimination deadline and shall enter any nominations necessary by such nomination deadline.\" Should this be more specific, perhaps something like : \"Peoples will confirm acceptance of these requests as soon as practicable prior to the nomination deadlione and shall schedule such nominations prior to the dealdine.\"? (The wording for no. 3 is similar to 1 and 2.) (3) Section 2.9 (ii) From a regulatory perspective, I prefer the bracketed language. As I noted regarding the last draft, a regulator would be concerned with an agreement commiting only to \"commercially reasonable efforts\" re compliance with the GTC, or a Law or Judgment. (4) Section 2.10. There is a typo in the second line from the bottom of 8, it's \"remains\" unpaid, not \"remain\". (note that this concept of a Peoples credit policy is consistent with Peoples' rights re denial of serivice under Section 8.2 of the GTC, which allows Peoples to refuse service based on a credit analysis.) (5) Section 5.1. At the time of the last draft, we discussed an additional representation for Peoples that \"it has provided MEH with a copy of the G&TC in effect as of the Effective Date\". This could inserted in 5.1 as (d), with a relettering of current d and e. (6) Section 7.2 I don't think the second to last sentence will work. This says that, if Peoples rejects an offered Extended Hub Transactions or doesn't timely accept, it can't enter into a similar transaction with the party involved for 6 months. The problem with this is that Peoples must provided Hub Service under the GTC, except when a ground for refusal stated in Section 8.2 of the GTC applies. The circumstances described in 7.2 are not a legitimate ground for refusal. I beleive, however, that we get to the same place if 7.2 were modified to require that Peoples pay MEH its percentage of Cumulative Net Revenues in the event that a transaction similar to one previously rejected for the same party is accepted within 6 mos. after termination of the Agency Agreement. (7) Section 8.3. Item (vi) of the list of functions could be expanded to state: \"assisting in the pareparation and filing of requests for Governmental Approval in accordance with Section 10.1 and/or the preparation of FERC reports that are required in the ordinary course of business and not specifically requested by FERC.\" I wan't sure of the intent re the last phrase of this. Does this mean that if a Report is specifically requested by FERC, MEH would be paid separetly for work on the Report? I would have thought that routine review of regulatory filings and work on reports might all fall into the category covered by the $50,000 payment, regardless of whether a particular report is requested. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks"

        "content": "Cypress Exploration Program - Operator/Cash Call Issue Rick: I wanted to inform you about a situation where a Commercial Team has subjected Enron to some material risk that did not get appropriate approval. Here's the story: On October 30, I received a funding request for my approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,500 exploratory well in the Cypress Program. The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don Rollins check it out . Don discovered that we had already paid our cash call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation. Checking further we discovered that the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from Kelley, who wanted to be operator. Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron (not Kelley) to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator. Kelley was upset about this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call provisons were deleted. Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department. The effect of this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and collect from Kelley. Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay their share of well costs before costs are incurred. This can be particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost overruns that partners don't want to pay. In this case, our surrogate operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be prepaid by Enron 100%. The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!) I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed that we are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut down operations. Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation (and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase. Lessons Learned: 1) The E&P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S. Louisiana exploratory test. 2) Important provisions, like \"cash call\" should never be given away without appropriate risk assessment and approval. Please call if you have questions. "

The laundry list of topics discussed is attached. We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO. We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process. However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this. We will try to get others to sign on to the comments. Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included: ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript). Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time). Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining). All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes. Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.

Tim's best intelligence is that a June 1 closing date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later. Also, until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come undone. If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in. Has Courtney got this covered? I suspect he's been thrashing around so much on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen. I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and the merger closing. (the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$) Also, we ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for us if the merger goes south for some reason. I drafted a letter awhile back that could be updated for this purpose. Susan, assuming Steve and company agree, could you follow up on this (I'm having Martha email it to you).

I understand that the loans will be unsecured but cross guarantied (i.e., Enron will guaranty the People's loans and vice versa), but I have several additional, basic questions re: the terms of the Enron loan and the intercreditor arrangements with Peoples. In terms of beginning drafting the loan documents, answers to questions 6(a) and 8 would be extremely helpful in selecting an appropriate form. 1. People's loan agreement -- will it be an exact clone of ours? 2. Guaranties -- will the cross-guaranties guaranty payment to the other venturer of all unpaid amounts under such venturer's loan agreement, or will they instead function more as an intercreditor/sharing agreement (i.e., if one venturer receives a payment that the other does not, the paid venturer will share its payment ratably with the unpaid venturer)? 3. Intercreditor Issues/Exercise of remedies -- Please confirm that there is to be no 100% lender vote requirement for acceleration, etc., and that each venturer can pursue remedies with respect to its loan independently (although I presume the facilities will be cross defaulted). 4. Advancing mechanics -- besides requiring ratable advances with the People's facility, will there be any conditions precedent to advances other than the typical no default/representations true & correct/no MAC? 5. Repayment -- will there be any commitment step-downs/mandatory prepayments? 6. Interest -- what will the (a) interest rate basis and (b) margin be? 7. Fees -- Will there be any sort of upfront fee? What will the commitment fee be? (And what will the amount of Enron's commitment be?) 8. Lender(s) -- Does Enron intend to keep its revolver as a single lender facility, or should we provide for a syndicated arrangement? 9. Other information -- When will specific financial covenant information be available? Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing. I look forward to working with you on this transaction.

Miller was promised the 4 7FAs based on his discussions with John concerning Enron's interest. GE is wavering a bit on this now, however, because other sales reps within GE have complained that we were given first crack. John characterized our current position as \"the front of the line without a pass\". 2. Ultimately (and obviously), Dell Williamson will decide to whom these turbines are allocated. 3. John said we should have a proposed letter agreement on the turbines this afternoon. He emphasized that they do not yet have the requisite GE internal approvals. Nonetheless, the major terms included in the Letter Agreement would be as follows: - Form of turbine purchase contract would be the GenPower 7FA turbine purchase agreement, modified to include standard Enron provisions negotiated between Sheila Tweed et. al. concerning assignment, indemnities, etc.; - the turbine purchase contract would need to be executed by the end of January; - 5% of the purchase amount would need to be paid upon execution of the Letter Agreement, with an additional 5% due at the end of the month. The balance of payments in the turbine purchase agreement would be paid in equal monthly instalments for each turbine through the respective turbine's delivery date (last day of each of March, April, May, and June); - we would be required to negotiate with GE in good faith on an LTSA, water system and STG (if needed). This would not be an exclusive, nor would we be subject to payment adders to the extent our good faith negotiations do not result in a definitive agreement. - the Letter Agreement will not be drafted as an option (even though it will essentially operate as one), but instead will be a letter agreement for the purchase of turbines. Unfortunately, the semantics of this are both important to us and GE, but I believe it will be extremely difficult to do anything other than the form and semantics that GE wants (as we are competing with other buyers who do not have the same balance sheet constraints as us). As such, we may want to consider an interim OBS vehicle such as LJM if the looseness of the contract presents challenges for the TurboPark banks. Lastly, given the somewhat tenuous nature of our queue position on the turbines, John strongly suggested that Delainey be immediately briefed, and that he call Dell as soon as possible based on the information John provided me in our conversation described above. He also suggested that we indicate to Dell that we have firm sites (Florida and Longview) for the units. John told me that this latter point is important to GE as they are becoming fatigued by their other customers who have slues of turbines and not enough sites to accommodate them. Let me know if you have any other questions. FYI, I put in a call to Lisa Bills on this deal, but have still not heard back from her. Regards, Ben"

Rena was working on a spec (the OSS that was discussed) that would automatically populate these 2 fields. However, the test was unsuccessful. These two fields are being opened up for netting, so we can input them manually when netting. I believe we need to pursue the auto fill post 7/1, but the first priority is having a place to put the data.

For data converted, we will not be able to get the settlement period in the same manner. The offsetting entry in conversion is to a dummy conversion account rather than an income statement account. The dummy account doesn't carry the settlement date. Another issue is related to the indicator to let us know if an invoice has had cash applied or "

Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation \"owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,\" and 2) a Network Customer \"must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract\" in order to designate a Network Resource. Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource: - permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems - Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation - allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity - since retail providers are allowed to rely on \"over-the-counter\" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources. It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

We commenced our work based on discussions with Jim Fallon, Ray Bowen and others about a week ago and plan to pay the employees with funds currently held by EEFT. I expect to receive tomorrow a formalized structure for the teams, again organized around EEFT. As I understand it, however, this proposal will not address any retention bonuses for the teams because this issue is still under discussion. I have been told that there is hesitancy on the part of some in Houston to provide for such payments but I do not know the reason for that hesitancy. May I suggest that it would be entirely appropriate to provide for retention payments in this case. As I have mentioned, part of this project is to recover value from existing contracts in entities such as ECTRIC, which value is estimated in the aggregate to be $150 to 200 million. Another aspect of the Corp. interest project is to properly wind up entities so as to recover value and minimize director liabilities. A proposal was made that a percentage of the recovered value would be put into a bonus pool and shared among all of the team members, whether those individuals had focused on recovery of funds or minimizing liabilities. I am told that this proposal was rejected in a conference call held today. I am very concerned about our ability to keep people working on this project without some additional incentive. The project is extremely difficult and many people, in particular the traders who are in a position to protect value in ECTRIC, have other job options. In addition, the employees on the team are aware that many individuals who are working on PWC teams are receiving retention payments. If the team to protect the ECTRIC interests is not retained in the short term, ECTRIC is scheduled to be put into administration on January 4, resulting in termination of many of its in-the-money contracts and a loss of an estimated 50% of its value. Jim, if you are inclined to support retention payments to help us maintain this effort going forward, will you please communicate that fact to Jim Fallon, Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen tomorrow, as it is likely we will begin to lose people after Christmas. Thank you. "

It has come to my attention that one more clarifying point needs to be made. Please allow me to explain the circumstances of the issue. The Consolidations group is gathering payment and refund information for the 10Q (the quarterly SEC report). In the 10Q, we have to provide the amount of payments we made and refunds we received by quarter. When gathering the information for the 3rd quarter, the Consolidations group noticed that prior quarter information changed in TIS. Since we cannot go back and change the information that we reported for the 1st or 2nd quarter 10Qs, those new payments/refunds have to be reported in the 3rd quarter. Now, our YTD TIS report does not tie to the information we provided for the 10Q. To keep the TIS report consistent from quarter to quarter, please do not add a payment or refund in TIS to a prior quarter. For example, as of today, we are still finalizing September business (the 3rd quarter). If you realized today that a refund should have been entered in TIS for May business, do not enter that refund in May business. Enter it in July business (the closest month in the next quarter). If, however, you realized today that a payment should be entered in August business, you can enter that payment in August business because August is part of the 3rd quarter which is the quarter we are currently reporting. Please note that it is OK to change the description of a prior quarter payment or refund. Just don't change any dollar amounts or add any new amounts. This issue just reemphasizes the need to tie out our TIS subledgers to general ledger every month. If we analyze the differences every month and enter the payments/refunds every month, this should not be a problem. SPECIAL NOTE: The Consolidations group has finalized the 3rd quarter payment and refund information for the 10Q that is due tomorrow. If you need to make any changes to payment / refund amounts in TIS, please contact Mary Sontag. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Given the current status of things, it would seem to me that there is no value in proceeding with the consent. On the other hand, we need to continue to build our case in the event of an arbitration with YPF. It would seem to me that the best thing would be for the lenders to tell Doris that the lenders' understanding is that, under the current project schedule, the conditions precedent under the YPF GSA cannot be satisfied, and that Enron and YPF have had some discussions regarding this issue and will continue to discuss the issue. Until the YPF GSA is restructured in some form, there is little value in proceeding on the consent, especially given that YPF and the lenders are still so far apart on the consent. The status of the YPF consent is as follows: Doris sent a revised draft of the consent to the lenders in August 2000. The lenders responded with comments (which included several of my comments) in October 2000. Doris then responded with a counter-draft in December 2000. Doris' latest draft again had numerous, significant comments, which I have not thoroughly reviewed. A quick review, however, indicates that Doris has cut in half many of the time periods for the lenders to cure SCG defaults. In addition, Doris has restructured several provisions in order to make certain YPF commitments run in favor of SCG only and not the lenders, which may be of no value to the lenders in a situation in which the lenders have to step into SCG's shoes. I am confident that the lenders will not accept Doris's comments, since many are proposals the lenders have rejected before. Let me know whether I should suggest to Dave Schumacher a response to Doris along the lines I recommend.

I can discuss this on the call with GE, but I wanted the Enron participants to know what our issues are. 1) Assignment - Generally, if GE is going to require that we list all the possible assignees, the list should be broad enough to encompass the possibilities. The comments below are designed to help make the language as broad and flexible as possible. It would be best if we did not have to list them. A. 22.2(iii) and (iv) - we need to make sure that the definition of \"Facility\" will be generic enough to cover any facility, not merely the one(s) which may be the subject of the particular agreement - also generally we will need to vet any defined term used in our sections to make sure it does not result in greater restriction than we planned ; B. I think we can remove the bracket before 22.2 (iii)(2) and add \"Purchaser\" to the list of folks who can agree to \"convey a power plant project.\" Also in that clause, we will need to confirm required \"timing\" of some power plant project development - does it mean only at the time of signing the agreement? It should be for any power plant project in development either at the time of signing the agreement, or any project in development in the future. Insert the number 3 before the last \"and\" in 22.2(iii); C. The paragraph following 22.2(iv)(c) has references to \"(v) and (vi)\" above, which are no longer in the list; D. The bold and bracketed language indicates that the terms of each of the \"Facility Agreements\" should be in \"strict conformity\" with the Ts and Cs of \"this Agreement.\" Although it is written in the context that there has been an assignment, Lisa wants to make sure that there is no expectation on GE's part that an Enron entity will necessarily remain as the \"Agent.\" Also, the language indicates that the assignee and the vendor will enter into an indemnity provision in the Facility Agreement that is in accordance with Exhibit E (last sentence). Does this still work given that the indemnity now runs only to the Purchaser? 2) Limitation of Liability - 27.2 and 27.3 We may need to explain to the Enron accountants and AA that the reference to \"indemnity\" in these sections does not create a separate indemnity obligation on Enron's or WLB's part. 3) Is the phrase \"cognizant government\" in 20.2(b) meant to apply to a governing body with jurisdiction over the Seller and/or Purchaser?

        "content": " lcampbel.nsf cking@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List: Roy, Thanks for sharing your concerns regarding the MOU pilot programs. I will include below a portion of the draft minutes from the April 18th NYISO Management Committee meeting which discuss the NYISO position on the CIT project. Initially, this project was viewed as a \"quick hit\" which could be completed swiftly, at minimal cost, and with minimal impact on staff and ongoing project work. Further discussion with PJM reveals that this will not be the case. Question on CIT/CSS: In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is either my misunderstanding, or conflicting information provided by NY and PJM. I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items. I will also make a similar request of PJM. 1) Common interface tool. My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do this entirely (or almost entirely) on their own, and just allocate some costs between NY and PJM. The product as I understood it would be available to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling. The users would input to the tool, and NY and PJM would basically get screened/coordinated input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout problems etc. If this was the case, I don't understand the comments at the BIC that NY wont be able to do this by the summer. Is this a PJM or NY constraint? Is PJM unable to complete what they offered? I can understand that that would hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work. However at the PJM EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go, could make the schedule, and just needed NY agreement. If this is a NY constraint I would also like to know more about it. Can you please clarify what is going on here? Response: (Reported by Mr. Museler to the MC on 4-18-2001) 1. There have been recent developments in the NYISO / PJM CIT process. At the present time, no software requirements document has been created, no vendor contracts have been signed, and a number of issues, including ensuring the confidentiality of data, providing redundancy in New York in case the PJM based system fails, and liability, all have to be resolved. When the project was originally proposed, the NYISO believed it could be done quickly with a limited amount of resources. This has not proven to be the case. Completing this project immediately would take resources away from other projects need for Summer 2001 and will have a budget impact of approximately $1 million. The NYISO does not believe it would be prudent to allow this project to come ahead of the Summer 2001 issues, or to proceed without vendor contracts in place and other outstanding issues resolved. The NYISO will continue work on the CIT process and will keep the Committees informed of developments. Question: 2) Inter ISO Congestion Pilot. I was disappointed in the \"lukewarm\" presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC. I realize that this program is very limited in scope, but it seems to me this is a very important precedent to the future coordination of the ISO's. As we left things it seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer. However, I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick said. He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey. At first blush this got a very negative response in the group. Then I started to think about this more. My understanding is the basic structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in A. Thus if PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation, presumably this was to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint. Now I am not a great electrical engineer, but my limited understanding of the systems suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY, this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY through the PSEG cable. Is this correct? IF CORRECT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR REDISPATCH IN PJM? I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion, otherwise we have some big problems. I would appreciate a further explanation of this, as perhaps I don't understand what is physically happening. Thanks for the help Response: With regard to the inter-ISO Congestion management pilot, Rick Gonzales offers the following response to your comments: 2. Please be advised that the NYISO fully supports the Inter-regional Congestion Pilot program. The Congestion Pilot will be presented again for comment at the Market Structures WG for further discussion and to facilitate the potential implementation of this program. One of the major issues noted in the presentation that limits the extent to which the Pilot program can be used is the potential for cost-shifting between ISOs. In addition to providing a list of 'candidate' operational constraints, it was also noted that it is the responsibility of each ISO to re-dispatch its internal control area resources to solve its own internal constraints. This concept is in agreement with your understanding that 'ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in A'. Any futher conclusions that one might imply from the Inter-regional Congestion Pilot should be discussed at the next Market Structures WG meeting. C. King adds the following with regard to the notion of increasing supplies to SENY and the operation of the PARs (Waldwick & Linden-Goethals/Hudson faragut): Since the initiation of the NYISO Markets, the full capability of the Hudson-Farragut PARs has not been available due to equipment failure. The equipment is expected to be back in service on or about the May-June period. In preparation for the return of the outaged PAR to service, NYISO and PJM staff have been discussing the operation of the PARs and the relationship of the PAR schedules to the PSEG-Con Edison Energy Transfer Agreements which have long been associated with this equipment. It would be pre-mature to establish a congestion-management pilot involving facilities in the electrical vicinity of the PARs, until the operating procedures related to the operation of the PARs is fully discussed and agreed to. Both PJM & NYISO acknowledged this at the Stakeholder Meeting in Toronto earlier this year, so this is nothing new. Presently the equipment owners (PSEG & Con Edison) as well as NYISO and PJM are engaged in discussions which should ultimately result in an operating agreement between PJM and NYISO regarding the operation and scheduling of the PARs. Progress is being made, thus I think that every effort is being made to insure that energy can flow between PJM and SENY, and between NY and New Jersey for this summer and beyond. We appreciate your encouragement of these efforts and other efforts to address seams issues in the northeast. See you in Springfield next Wednesday! Chuck "

        "content": " jlavora.nsf SEABROOK P&L Booking the 200 MW Seabrook position through for calender 2001 results in a positive $23.5 million. For background purposes, UI has a 17.5% ownership interest in the Seabrook nuclear facility (total facility is 1142 MW). The other owners of Seabrook are as follows: Northeast Utilities 40% (they are driving the sale - it is a condition on their Con-Ed merger) Great Bay Power 12% (they have announced their intention on selling) New England Power 10% Other minority owners 20% (8 small minority municipal & IOU owners) The Seabrook facility has been on the auction block for the past 6-9 months, and given the uncertainty of the timing of the sale, Dana & I felt it was imprudent to book calender year 2001 until we knew with certainty that the plant asset transfer (and associated state, NRC and FERC approvals) would occur after 2002. Remember contractually, EPMI's 200 MW PPA position terminates upon final closure of a UI sale of its 17% interest. With respect to Millstone, Pilgrim and Maine Yankee nuclear asset sales, the majority owner drives the sale process and minority owners generally almost always sell their interest at the same price as the majority owner. With respect to UI's 17.5% interest in Seabrook, UI has already informed us they intend on selling their interest along with the majority owner. Obviously, the plant has not yet been sold and I feel comfortable (given a 10-12 month approval process coupled with Seabrook's politically sensitive location in New Hampshire) booking the 200 MW position through 2001. ICAP P&L Given the huge regulatory uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of ICAP in NE, Dana is uncomfortable taking any of the $55 million to income at this time. Basically, our opinion is that the regulatory decision will either result in a default price of $0.50-1.00/kW/Mo (resulting in approx $20-30 million postive P&L) or a default price of $3-3.50/kW/Mo (loss of $20-30 million). The ICAP decision has once again been removed from the FERC agenda for next Wednesday's meeting. This is the 3rd time that has happened in the past 2 months and indicates a lack of consensus at FERC. Given this FERC indecisiveness and the current situation in California and reliability issues in both the Western and Eastern US in general, I am very concerned that FERC does not have the political guts to pull the plug on ICAP (or lower the default price to low penalty rate). Given this regulatory situation, there is a 50/50 chance we lose additional money and a 50/50 chance we make additional money. Said another way, we would likely use the entire $55 million in ICAP $'s to completely hedge ICAP through the term of UI. In addiiton, there was a FERC ruling regarding PJM ICAP today that said $4.00+/kW/Mo for PJM ICAP was indeed market based and not market manipulated. This coupled with FERC's lack of decision for 3+ months on NE ICAP makes us very uncomfortable. The good news is we are not short PJM ICAP. "

PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill. The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations. PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers' first utility bill. We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices. They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills. My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection. I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved. However, I have not sent a written request. I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request. We also have an issue with SCE. They are transferring debit balances to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.

The attached document is formatted in MS Word for Windows 97. We talked on the telephone about a letter or opinion regarding the Counterparty being subject to the Utah Nonprofit Corporation and Co-operative Association Act (the \"Utah Nonprofit Act\") and the Counterparty having authority under the Utah Nonprofit Act and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to enter into the Confirmation and perform the Transaction. In that regard, the attached form of opinion requests those opinions from the Counterparty's outside counsel (see paragraphs 1, 2 and 3). I think the Counterparty's outside counsel is in a much better position to give Enron these opinions, and, I believe, its counsel should be able to give those opinions with a minimum amount of research and due diligence.

As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron.

Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations.

Application development is not currently occurring on a single version of the database. Therefore, some issues could arise as each development team migrates to the standard. This needs to happen relatively quickly. Specific Issues: GFD_PIPE_METERS_SNP - Probably need to add FAC_TYPE (WH, ITE, etc) for possible use as validation in KX functionality GAS_DEAL_LOCATION_DTL - This table refers to facility number rather than pipe and meter. Facility number is an Enronism that no other company will recognize. Pipe and Meter General - Should try to avoid using Pipe_Cd as key. This value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold. - Data for Facilities is heavily dependent upon Enron Global Facilities Database in current design and functionality-this needs revisiting as the decision surrounding Global is made CP_ADDR_VW - This table references only internal_cp_id and contact_type_cd in conjunction with address_id. Addresses are specific to internal_cp_id, product_cd, deal_nature_cd, contact_type_cd, and region_cd. Need to add deal nature, product, and region to ensure correct address usage since many companies align their business along these determinants and addresses may vary COUNTERPARTY - There is a mixture of the usage of Global Counterparty. Some areas indicate a certain amount of independence from Enron's Global Counterparty system, by having a table to capture Commodity Logic information on a counterparty such as phone numbers, credit ratings, etc. This would position CL to become independent at a later date. Yet, Commodity Logic functions as a subset of Enron Networks and GCP must make entries to indicate the usage of a customer by Enron Networks to obtain an SAP id and support payment processing through to SAP. So, CL could not become independent without further functionality or process changes. So why not put the added data requirements within GCP to start with? If Global moves to Commodity Logic, then this design needs to be revisited for sure. There should probably be some standardization between dependence/independence whether or not CL separates from Enron. Common Data - Status is not included in the views being utilized by the applications. I hope the views have been filtered for active status only. Show was going to check on this. - Concept of mapping others' codes to ours for processing, is not supported anywhere in these tables. Perhaps that has been handled in an isolated manner in the FIX design? This will have to be there for internal release as well as external release. This is critical to the hub concept. I look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues. Let me know if you have further questions. "

Because of cumulative blacklining, they are not separately identified, but they were to add \"or the Designee\" in the parenthetical at the end of Section 4. More significantly, I reinserted our cure rights if you are in default of this Agreement. You had changed it to arise only in the event of a \"Default under the Master Netting Agreement.\" We need it in either case. Regarding UCCs. We are giving you a clean release under El Paso's release procedures. Hence I do not see the need to do a UCC search. If you would like, we will give you a representation that we hold the Pipeline Capacity free and clear of any liens or encumbrances, but then we would expect you to give us a covenant not to create or permit to create any lien or encumbrance on the Pipeline Capacity, all of which is implicit in any event. Also, since you possess the Pipelien Capacity outright, there is no need for a security interest grant to you. To give you a security interest under the El Paso tariff, we need to use the whole Trust and Assignment Agreement that we drafted originally. Moreover, if we must do that to give you a security interest in something you already possess, then it becomes patently unfair to deny us a reciprocal security interest in the Pipeline Capacity, which, after all, we do not hold in our possession. One of the points of giving you the present release without the recall right was that you were not satisfied with the security interest route. In short, we think it adds no protection for you and creates significant additional burden for us (and for you in documentation).

None was as aggressive as, nor had the presence of, Kathy Patrick.? However, Tom Hatch is quite good and definitely to be taken seriously.? The other two made little impression. A lot of the questions today focused on Thai graft and corruption, with the suggestion that Busse, Stickler, and others (implicitly Enron) knew that it was there and did not really do anything to try to stop it. A number of questions resulted in the appearance (perhaps true) that the Managment Company never really functioned, certainly not effectively.? The argument was NOT that the Management Company did not have enough power, but rather that the Management Company effectively abdicated, leaving everything to Schultes. All of this made me slightly nervous.? I wonder if the bondholders could argue that the members of the Management Company has a fiduciary duty to the bondholders during the months after the offering to exercise the power that they had to stop graft and improve operations.? If there were such a legal duty (and there may well not have been), then the facts would probably not be good for the Management Company members. In fact, the way that the Managment Company LLC agreement was structured, all power was in the hands of a single individual manager--David Stickler--and the only power that the members had was to remove Stickler (which would have required unananimity between ECT Thailand and SDI).? Although the Managment Company had a few \"meetings,\" it is not clear what this means or, legally, who met at all, as the management Company had no board or governing body other than the individual manager. Other themes: ??????? SDI was having trouble with its own DRI facility and really wanted access to information about NSM's DRI facility. ??????? Everyone knew that John Schultes had no minimill experience (and might be corrupt) and that the project would fail unless Nucor or SDI agreed to run it, which neither did.? Stickler kept picturing SDI as managing NSM, but SDI steadfastly declined the role. We should finish tomorrow.

We recognize that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron's business goals, and we are pleased that many of you have shared in the company's financial success through Enron stock options. As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program. Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron's continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package. On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program). It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, is as follows: ? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations. ? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.) ? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000. ? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant of stock options. Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program, among other good reasons=01( that's why. In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your questions, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your Human Resources representative. Note: In addition to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, granting of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron companies' employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refine the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

        "content": "Organizational Changes To: Enron North America Corp. From: Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets, and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce the following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA. 1) Coverage/Origination: To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service companies and IPP's; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries. Downstream Coverage/Origination As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear that the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp. Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp. Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENA's existing energy commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also EES's energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel's chemicals, plastics and refined products risk management capability. These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg's leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering: a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision of paper risk management products; b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries; c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers Trust's global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to leadthe coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing industries. Midstream Coverage/Origination a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group' activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect. We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of this group; b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. They will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring opportunities in the Western U.S. We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination efforts; c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio's of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group. In addition, Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect; d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructuring opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets. We have asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair, formerly of Enron Asia's development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join this newly formed business. 2) Commercial Transactions: The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA's efficiency in executing transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage. CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management. The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership, execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups. This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions: a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western Coverage/Origination Groups. The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy Lemmons joined Enron in 1992. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA's industrial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining, Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established. The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich. We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups. The senior members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud and John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix. We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups. The senior members of this team include Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert. We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend. Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams. Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group. The remaining four groups within CTG will remain largely unchanged. In addition, the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together. We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ENA's markets particularly in the industrial markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups. Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in North America by working with us to implement these changes. "

I received the magazine's April-9 issue today, and confirmed Enron was carried as a real cover-story with 16 pages in it. It uses 8 pages to cover Enron and Enron Japan, and uses another 8 pages to discuss other electricity-deregulation related topics in Japan. The deregulation-related parts also include stories which are very much supportive to Enron Japan's messages - such as Japan's electricity prices are 2-3 times higher than the international average. The headline of \"Enron Arrives\" with Enron Logo is on the magazine's front page, and photos of Enron building and others that we provided are nicely used in the article. The article itself is more or less balanced one which is good enough to introduce Enron to the Japanese audience, though the reporter uses ironic expressions here and there. The article also includes a column on California crisis with the jump headline of \"the cause of the California problem is not deregulation, but is miserable design of regulation.\" Thanks to your contribution, I believe this project proved a great success, and the article will successfully raise Enron's visibility in Japan, while our commercial staff will be able to show this high-profile magazine to their potential customers and business partners. Thank you so much again for your time and help, and I will send you full translations of the article early next week. I hereby attached some of scanned photocopies of the article. warm regards, Mika "

For the past several months,a project team, representing Enron's temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team's efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition. We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001. The scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two phases have been completed. Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we selected CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group based on their exceptional management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our staffing needs. The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective and simple means for obtaining temporary employees. In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group will be communicating to Enron's administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors about the new process. There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are outlined on the attached page. More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed Services team. What is Managed Services? CORESTAFF's Managed Services program includes: ? Vendor-neutral management model ? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners ?

We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

John Tysse at EEAC indicated that the new leadership at DOL and at OFCCP is very business oriented. The new OFCCP director is Charles James; he wasthe EEO manager at Bell Atlantic. However, he is new in the job, of course, and has not had any opportunity to review enforcement policy issues. Thus, Tysse is not aware of any policy shifts to date, nor is he aware of any volume mailing of the kind of letter Enron received. Tysse is hearingthat DOL and OFCCP leadership will probably take a cautious (i.e., deliberate) approach to changes so as not to unnecessarily provoke outbursts from Congress or advocacy groups. But the word is that policy reevaluations will occur. (This includes the EEO survey, which Felicia asked about thismorning, although Tysse speculated that the survey issue might be too politically charged to drop altogether; perhaps it will be reworked to be more manageable.) While there has been no indication of a formal enforcementpolicy shift as to Dubray cases, Tysee said he is aware of another ongoing case where the national office appeared to be pulling the strings, even though the region was still handling dialogue with the contractor. Len Bierman, the former career Deputy Director at OFCCP who is now a consultant, said about the same thing as Tysse as to the new DOL and OFCCP leadership being sensitive to issues that concern business and the fact that they have not been in place long enough to effect changes yet. (There is not yet an Asst. SOL for Employment Standards.) He is not aware of any push to clear out Dubray cases pending in the national office. However, he knows Busch well from their agency days and does not believe he is stronglycommitted to the Dubray methodology because he understands its deficiencies. His guess is that the letter may signal a desire by the national office to find a way to get your case off their docket. I have sent an email (you are blind copied) to some folks at law firms around the country to see if they know of similar letters being sent. I willkeep you advised. Best regards. W. Carl Jordan Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. 1001 Fannin 2300 First City Tower Houston, Texas 77002 (713) 758-2258 (713) 615-5334-fax "

I will be in your Houston offices on Tuesday, April 17th. I am writing to ask if you would be available to meet sometime that afternoon. You may recall meeting my partner, Mike Morgan, in Portland about three to four years ago. Mike has worked with Enron on the PGE/Sierra deal and other matters as well. I am the senior partner at our firm who specializes in labor and employment law. I am a former partner at Littler Mendelson in San Francisco and continue to enjoy a close relationship with that firm. I have been working with Rick Johnson, Director of Labor and Employment Relations at Enron Corp. We have been handling the labor issues associated with an energy management agreement--Project Neon. Rich Freed is lead counsel. We are working on a project labor agreement in connection with the construction of a power plant--Project Epic. Randy Pais is overseeing that matter.

        "content": "Form Settlement Agreement Richard - I have a small contract matter involving Enron Credit that requires a settlement agreement. Basically, EC orally agreed to have a third party develop and host a website that would provide the EC information to site subscribers. These subscribers might also be subscribers to other products promoted by the third party. The written agreement backing up the oral agreement was due to be finalized on Friday of last week, but, as you can imagine was not actually signed. As EC is not pursuing its business at this time, it has asked to terminate the relationship with this third party - a termination that will cost $96K. I have been asked to do a settlement agreement and was wondering if there is any particular form that Enron uses or that you may have for this type of deal. It is rather simple in nature, but we do want to make sure that all necessary release language is included. Thanks. Mark"

They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness. I'm not sure I understand why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of the language and wanted your thoughts on this. Alos, does the second part of the language need to be updated or revised in any manner? 2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger. 3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of Default trigger. Should we specify a threshold? 4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual ratings triggers. For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this additional Termination Event? I don;'t think the cure language works and I don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger for that to go to zero is something else. 5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger. 6.

        "content": " tjones.nsf We are launching a number of committees to perform key functions across Enron. Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company. Broadening participation will result in increased access to information as decisions are made and will allow committee members to extend their working relationships and influence throughout the company. The committee charters and memberships are set forth below. Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance. We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair. VP PRC The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director. Additionally, the VP PRC will review and propose changes to the PRC process, the performance evaluation criteria and the promotion criteria. The VP PRC will be chaired by Dave Delainey and its membership is as follows: Tim BeldenBen GlisanDanny McCarty Michael BrownJoe GoldJeff McMahon Rick BuyMark HaedickeRob Milnthorp Wes ColwellJim HughesMatthew Scrimshaw David CoxLouise KitchenJeff Shankman Janet DietrichMichael KopperRichard Shapiro Dave DuranJohn LavoratoMarty Sunde Jim FallonDan Leff Analyst/Associate PRC The analyst/associate PRC will be divided into 3 groups.

The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area. Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization. We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program. Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe. The members of this committee are listed below. Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program. Billy joined Enron in 1992, and has served in a variety of commercial capacities across the company and has been an active participant in the Associate /Analyst program.

        "content": "FW: Hi All- Attached above is the master list of contracts we'll need for Day 1 of NEWCO. As the footnotes indicate, we'll also need new business party ID's/passwords, an EBB agreement for all pipes and a TPA for each EDI pipe (Tammy & I will be working on TPA's and EBB's). The timing indicated assumes that we have a clear NEWCO structure, that the NEWCO credit status has been identified, and that a DUNS number has been established. The two week estimate is built on working through the pipelines' credit process as an entirely new entity and on turning the contracts through Legal on each end, so it may be shorter for some of the simpler agreements but in any event we should estimate at least 3-5 days even for pooling agreements. For the LDC's and intrastates, we'll need to specifically identify what each requires. As we discussed, we need to call each pipeline and identify the following information: Pipeline contact name and number (I know some of you sent me this b/f--but pls make sure that it's the legal/regulatory contact, not your business counterpart) Credit requirements for a NEW entity with an \"A\" credit rating (they may just refer you to the tariff, if so, pls. ask them for a specific site so we can do the research) Get a sense of the reaction of the pipe/LDC regarding credit for the new entity--we can set up a discussion between our legal and theirs so we can resolve those issues and move forward to contracting. in the event that any of them raise the issue of paying any of the old Enron bills, just reiterate that we're setting up a completely new entity and give them Bob's, mine, or Jeff Hodge's name to discuss the estate issues. If there are different requirements for different service levels (ie, pooling vs. IT vs. FT), pls ask them to specify so that we can get the easier agreements in place first and get business started on the pipe. We need to get a hard copy of the contract for each service level--pls. ask the pipe/LDC to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it. Once we have those together, I'll run the traps with Legal. It would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier, then work on the second. I will be out of the office Thursday & Friday, but please call me on my cell phone at 713-516-2574 with any questions. Thanks, Suzanne"

I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J. She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions. Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date. Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said. I see two options: 1. If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is: I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today. If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today. Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started. 2. If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is. Caveat: I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly. Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys. I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running. If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know. I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do. Britt "

I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of EnronOnline: 1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email) 2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) - otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved. It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access the long descriptions in the Product Manager 3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who should be looking after this? Mark Taylor Leslie Hansen Jeff Hodge Janice Moore Alan Aronowitz Harry Collins Stacy Dickson 4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's against the products and see what you think? Thanks for your help Dave "

        "content": "IMPORTANT ! ! Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that ESPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the Commission by December 3. The contracts will be available to ALL other parties who sign a \"suitable\" protective order. The Ordering Paragraphs read as follow: 1. By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct access contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend direct access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001, shall submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreements along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order. A failure to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be considered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contracts and agreements. Initially, the true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commission's Docket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Robert Barnett. 2. Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have executed direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed protective order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which shall be submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3. 3. The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall work with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission staff by December 11, 2001. 4. Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in response to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by January 4, 2002. As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own names, have direct access contracts. However, certain members of AReM and WPTF are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they wish to take. The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds. I will be considering our options and get back to you with more detail. However, as a very preliminary analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over either ESPs or the customers they serve. The request is also particularly outrageous because of the statements that, \"A failure to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be considered a waiver of the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreements\" and \"Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts and agreements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agreements are in effect.\" The former is a likely denial of due process and the latter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP competitors and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energy-dependent customers. Your thoughts would be appreciated. My initial reaction is that this is time for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC, SPURR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the Governor's Office on down, including in the media.

Candidly, I don't see how Murtha can continue to represent us in lobbying for the subject transactions and represent CRRA in lobbying and legal representation for the same transactions without conflicts or creating the appearance of impropriety, and the markup reflects that scepticism by trying to segregate out the representation cleanly. Also, to the extent the original draft indicated Murtha had represented both CRRA and Enron re the transactions until now, we need to make sure that we are OK with waiving that conflict as a substantive matter. I'm not familiar enough with the representation to know if Enron's interests could have been compromised during that period of dual representation, and I do not think we should agree to the waiver until we are comfortable on that score.The letter also now makes clear that Murtha will not be able to represent either party or their affiliates in litigation involving them.

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.

In November, I should have a bit more time to spend on this opportunity. If you are simply looking for a local partnership to work on projects, I will steer you to Alan or one of our local staff members in the region. Again, thank you for the interest and I look forward to working with you on a mutually beneficial partnership. Dan "

Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission. Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors. New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming. In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses. All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation. Pre-Petition Expenses We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000. We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses. This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel. We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses. We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap. Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through. Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returning to Washington except to serve again in national office, I would be pleased to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter. In recalling our conversation, I realize that twice you asked if I had any questions, and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer, I would have asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does Joe Hillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman who currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron; to whom does she report? Then there is Joe Allen, whom I have known since our days in the Legislature; doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs? I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers, it's clear that government relations are much more central to the work of Enron than at Compaq, which is why it would be a very exciting place to work.

I have gone through it and plugged in the relevant information I have from the Summary Sheet that GE approved earlier. What I don't have, and am most interested in obtaining from whatever source has them, are the following: 1. Purchase price information (based on the current outstanding balance) 2. Payment schedule (based on current outstanding balance) for Section 6.1.2. 3. The massive volume of specifications and GE boilerplate that is to be attached to the contract as Exhibits and Schedules. 4. A form for Exhibit U, setting out the correct site-adjusted information for these 4 turbines. 5. Unit number identifications and guaranteed delivery dates for each of the turbines. We are prepared to fill in the unit-specific information beyond that which we have already incorporated in the body of the document, and can fill in specific numbers in Exhibit U, but need to have the remaining information. Please note that there appears to be a couple of residual references in the contract that may not or are not relevant to all contracts. First, Section 10.10.6 (regarding maximum aggregate liquidated damages) references 30% of the Purchase Amount. It should be 30% of the Maximum Liability Amount (according to the summary GE approved earlier). Second, the contract provides for \"Optional Electrical Output Guaranty\" and associated liquidated damages in 10.7.3. This guaranty by its terms applies only to installations utilizing 6 or more turbines. I have deleted it from the LV contract. In addition, Bill Williams has told me that the site-adjusted performance levels that GE provided for the summary information sheet are different (and less favorable to the project ) than those GE provided him in other documents. We will need to confirm those numbers with GE. Is there a contact point at GE whom we should talk with about getting the information/Exhibits we need, or do we have the information already? Please let me know. We are in serious need of providing a document to our prospective purchaser. "

I am trying to initiate a system to fully integrate an industry that is fragmented and in need of adding scalable 'process' efficiencies. This will require substantial resources that are not available to me. These resources would be less significant to a company like Enron Corporation. However the upside potential would, I believe, be significant to your corporation. The risk reward ratio in this marketplace favors the upside potential significantly. This market is ripe for innovation because of the fundamental need to improve product and service delivery in a cost effective and timely manner. The process has already begun but will require a critical mass player that can deliver open-market eProcurement. The process related savings alone will be approximately $11 billion annual when an effective supply chain system is implemented. The timing is critical since in the next 18- 36 months the winners and losers would have already lined up for success and failure. A linchpin is needed and it could well be Enron. I have little doubt that Enron could do the job and become the stand-alone leader in this field. I am writing to Enron Corporation to determine your potential interest in a very large global marketplace that is poised for transformation and transition. This marketplace is currently valued in excess of $300 billion annual worldwide with high profit margins as well as large continuing revenue growth rates in excess of 10% annually. There are buy and sell side opportunities for revenues as well as a transactional fee opportunity. What I am proposing would be the critical next innovative step to enter a new level of global sourcing, purchasing, risk management and distribution for this industry. I realize the vagueness and brevity of my comments but without an existing level of confidentiality I cannot expand these thoughts. If you have interest in taking one additional step to determine if my strategic concept has merit please let me know.

If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read, copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify the sender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system. Thank you. _______________________________________________________________ These are my comments re the draft Petition forwarded by Peoples on Friday: (1) The Petition describes PERC in paragraph and refers to PERC in par. 3. PERC, however, is not a party to the Master Agreement, and the Petition does not discuss request any relief with respect to PERC. I don't see why there is a need to reference PERC. (2) It is my understanding that, under the Master Agreement, there will be two types of transactions: (a) simple buy/sells at a clear market price; and (b) complex transactions with sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures. As we have discussed, the first type of transaction, simple buy/sells at a market price fall under an exemption to Section 7-101's approval requirement (220 ILCS 5/7-101(4)). These types of transactions do not require ICC approval and MEH/Peoples are free to engage in such transaction now. I would suggest that the Petition point this out, particularly if (as I suspect is the case) MEH and Peoples are now conducting such transactions or may wish to do so before the ICC acts on the Master Agreement. Because the Master Agreement covers certain transaction which need approval and other which do not, I would suggest that the Petition make this clear and request approval only \"to the extent required\". (This was the language used by NIGAS in seeking approval of a buy/sell agreement in Docket 95-0302.) (3) With respect to the transactions which do require approval (the complex ones with sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures), the draft Petition doesn't say much. It says (Par. 5) that transactions under the Agreement will optimize the use of the gas supply and capacity assets of Peoples and MEH; (Par. 9) that Peoples has similar master contracts with non-affiliated entities; (par. 10) that the agreement will not interfere with Peoples' operations; and (par. 10) that the Agreement is in the best interest of Peoples and its customers. All of these statements are fine to include, but the ICC is likely to want to know more about why the agreement is in the public interest. Perhaps a sentence or two could explain how the Agreement will optimize Peoples' use of its gas supply and capacity assets (e.g., by using capacity which otherwise would be idle) and how this will benefit Peoples' Illinois ratepayers (e.g., a credit to PGA gas costs). Also, Peoples is asking that the ICC pre-approve an arrangement under which the \"details\" of individual transactions will be filled in later. As I understand it, the \"details\" will include such things as the level of management fees and other compensation terms. To facilitate approval, it would be best to have some sort of guideline to suggest to the ICC, i.e., a management fee within a certain amount or percentage of a specified index level. If there is an industry standard approach that could be referenced, that may be of use. The Petition suggests that there are other Agreements of this type with non-affiliates. Perhaps reference could be made to pricing provisions under one or more of those agreements. If it is not possible to be any more specific, I am concerned that the ICC may want to wait and review individual transaction rather than giving blanket approval without knowing more. (4) The ICC approval process can take 4-5 months (sometimes more) to complete. The required approval time, however, can be cut down significantly when the apprval filing includes a Peition and supporting testimony that lays out all the information needed to conclude that a proposed arrangement is in the public interest (the interest of Illinois ratepayers). The Petition itself need not include all the details (it need only lay out the case ingeneral terms). A filing package which, with accompanying testimony, tells the full story will expedite the approval process. "

This memo serves as a reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made by risk management groups. differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many of your ba's don't. when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit. Flat books must be officialized market risk is keyed off positions and curves. When we make money, market risk is reduced. Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers. When we make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money. how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk Market risk picks up all officialized books. If a book is not officialized it does not pick the book up. Credit picks up all officalized books. If a book is not officialized, it picks up the previous day's position. Therefore, if positions in book A are moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the previous day's position for book A.

The parties in this deal are Kleimar N.V. from Antwerp Belgium, and ECTRIC through EEFT. We are entering into a Time Charter agreement, where Kleimar charters a vessel from us (the one obtained in the original Mitsui deal) , and then through a Contract of Affreightment we will be receiving five voyages (different ships). I will follow up on the timing of these in my next email. We will put in place a Master Agreement which should allow us to net out these two contracts (the Time Charter and the COA) as well as any other future physical business we enter into with them, if anything goes wrong. The Master sets out default and cross default events. This will allow us to have tighter control over the counterparty. I have attached a draft of the Master Agreement which will be signed at the same time as the Time Charter and the COA. So overall this deal will have three documents. The Time Charter, the COA and the Master Agreement. Kleimar is giving us a Letter of Credit for 250,000 to cover our exposure, which has been agreed by Credit. We will be receiving the Time Charter and COA docs shortly which I will send around. The changes in those documents reflect the principles in the Master Agreement. Please let me know if anyone has any concerns or issues with this deal as soon as possible. (0207 783 4084). Ian "

In the event you get any questions from anyone about this case, I attach a short (by my wordy standards) summary of the facts and issues in dispute. In addition to what is mentioned in the attached summary, please note that we have two motions for summary judgment pending. The first is a liability motion arguing that the contract is clear on its face and supports our definition of Delivery Point. If granted, this motion would dispose of all of the plaintiffs' claims, result in a liability judgment in favor of Enron and leave only Enron's damages to be tried. The second motion for summary judgment argues that, because the plaintiffs never made a claim for the tax credits they allege to have lost and cannot prove that they would not have received them, even if Enron was in breach of the parties' agreement, then plaintiffs' damage claim is entirely speculative and must be denied. Finally, despite a good bit of effort on our part, several meetings and a business related settlement offer made to plaintiffs several months ago, the plaintiffs have never responded or made a counter proposal.

There is nothing more important to ENA than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people. Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool. It provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only determinant. In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following: a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately; b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues. For the satisfactory category, the message should focus on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity. The bar is always being raised. For the needs improvement category, the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months. For the issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better \"fit\" in the organization or counsel out. Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance. Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st. I anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process. Associate and Analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th. Other identified action items from the meetings include: a) the HR group will put together a \"profile and performance book\" for ENA's A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the July 19th meeting; b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to continue rotating within ENA; c) ENA will be holding an additional \"off-cycle\" A&A super-saturday for Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area; and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week. Please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof. Please communicate to your organization as appropriate. Regards Mark and Dave"

In reviewing them, I have the following comments: The paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues. We carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this. Also, how can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ?

        "content": "Alberta PPA Financing I thought I might try to sum up. It seems to me that we both need to finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of next week. 1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap structure including the credit and covenant package. 2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have one prepared. Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes. Frankly, unless and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations are, it is difficult if not impossible to prepare documentation. For example: (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee they were expecting from Enron Corp. I was trying to require the Bank to accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities. Based upon this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may have a problem to resolve. However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank. (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law. However, I now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law. (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable. (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to Enron Canada. Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal opinions. (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine. I suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable. (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed. (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank. This presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults. At the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be capable of being set-off. We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements. (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent upon a final understanding of the swap structure. (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap structure. Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate \"fee letter\" to recover its fees. More problematically, the Bank was not clear as to how \"increased costs\" would be accounted for in the swap structure. Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those increased costs are flowed through. They were not sure how this could be accommodated in a swap structure. I suggested that there may be some way to fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes or through a separate indemnification in the \"fee letter\". (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank. For example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the Bank in connection with the transaction. Of course this depends on finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants package. In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper as soon as possible. Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning. Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external expectations. It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday morning. Regards, Peter"

Documenting the deal as a loan does not add any protection for Enron and in fact, may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and lenders. The protections and remedies afforded by the Master track those that Enron would have under a loan document. Enron would be in no better position to collect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement. Additionally, I assume that NUI, being a regulated utility, will not want to or be able to document this deal as a loan. Please let me know if you need additional information on this topic. Stacy "

        "content": "E-Signature Protocol Mark: Pursuant to our discussion last week, below is a rough draft of a proposal for an electronic signature protocol, which could be presented to ISDA for further consideration and discussion after we have further discussed: E-Signature Protocol Objective: In light of the enactment of the US federal legislation on electronic signatures (effective as of 10/1/00), a simple, reliable, and enforceable protocol should be established to facilitate the electronic execution of Master Agreements (and confirmations where required). To facilitate the wider use of electronic contracts, this protocol could be endorsed by ISDA. Hopefully, it would become a standard that others would use for all types of contracts. Perhaps, if necessary or helpful, the adoption of the protocol could be done electronically by each party unilaterally agreeing to abide by it, possibly using the same type of approach ISDA used in connection with the introduction of the EMU currency a few years ago. Initially, the protocol would be primarily applicable to U.S. counterparties, but it could be expanded to non-U.S. counterparties as e-signature laws like the new U.S. law are enacted across the globe. Basic Protocol: By adopting the protocol, each counterparty would agree that the relevant agreement may be electronically signed by complying with the following steps: 1) The parties negotiate and agree on a final form the relevant agreement, and appoint one of the parties (\"First Party\") to prepare the document for electronic signature; 2) The First Party prepares the final form in the PDF format (e.g., the body of the text could not be modified) with the exception of the blank signature blocks for each party to be placed on the last page of the agreement; 3) An authorized signatory of the First Party electronically signs the agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by inscribing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in his/her name and title in the blank signature block); 4) The agreement, as electronically signed by the First Party, is sent via electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the First Party to the other party (\"Second Party\"); 5) An authorized signatory of the Second Party electronically signs the agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by impressing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in his/her name and title in the signature block); 6) The agreement, as electronically signed by the Second Party, is sent via electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the Second Party to the First Party, accordingly, creating the fully executed agreement; and 7) Each party would be responsible for maintaining in its own electronic archives the agreement as electronically signed by the parties. Also, the following could be considered: (a) adding to the protocol that each party,by adopting the protocol, agrees to be bound by any agreement entered into by means of the protocol, and any other appropriate language to enhance the enforceability of the \"e-signature\" process and (b) adding to the preprinted form of the Master Agreement, a provision whereby each party adopts the electronic signature protocol endorsed by ISDA as in effect from time to time. Mark, I would be happy to discuss this draft proposal with you further at your convenience. Regards, Alan "

He has recommended that the better approaches would be either to retain Mike Webster, an Indian lawyer in Montana, or find a lawyer in Florida who has had direct experience with Seminoles.

Gary Johnson (R.) earlier this year. The new laws require the PRC to move Qwest Corp. (formerly U S WEST Communications, Inc.) to an alternate form of regulation. The association also urges \"appropriate funding\" for the PRC to accomplish the move. The association's recommendations were included in a 2001 legislative agenda released late last week. "

The procedures for its use are unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences. One item to note: the form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see http://hrweb.enron.com). For electronically submitted expense reports, enter the same number on the receipt envelope. The form is now available at the SAP website. To access the form: From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com Choose one of the following paths: Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms Click SAP Expense Report Form Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms Click SAP Expense Report Form Wait for it to load Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros) After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a new filename.

According to such a hearing term, it has been designated a discovery hearing at court for May 30th, 2001, at 3 p.m., occasion in which a company representative of EPCB, with his employee booklet (CTPS), shall attend the hearing, as well as up to three witnesses that may be able to testify favorably to EPCB. In this sense, below please find the subject over which evidence shall be produced by EPCB at such a discovery hearing: i) that EPE hired the Superior Construction Company in order to build the thermo electric plant; ii) that the Superior Construction Company has entered into a re-hiring agreement with the Siemens Ltda. company in order to build the thermo electric plant, company which, in its turn, has hired the ENESA company for such a purpose; iii) that the Superior Construction Company has used EPCB in order to diligence in the sense that the thermo electric plant building was been performed in accordance with the hired by and between the EPE and Superior Company Construction companies; iv) that the claimant was an employee of the ENESA company; that ENESA company paid the employee's salaries; that EPE and EPCB have never contacted the claimant; that the ENESA company was the responsible for the selection of the professionals that it understood as necessary for the services compliance; that it was up to ENESA company to give commands to the claimant; that it was ENESA company that determined the services to be performed by the claimant. We would also like to inform that it has been determined by the court the deadline of 15 days for EPCB to present at the case files (i) its articles of associations; (ii) power of attorney and (iii) company representative letter. For such, we kindly request that such documents, duly certified, be forwarded directly to our local correspondent attorney in Cuiab? - Ms. Luciana Cristina Pereira Cardoso, at the address, Av. Historiador Rubens de Mendon?a, 1836, sala 905, bairro Bosque da Sa?de, Cuiab?, MT, up till May 18th, 2001, so that we may present them at the case files in the stipulated deadline. Also, we would like to stress that in case EPCB decides to indicate a company representative that has not the Portuguese as his mother language to attend the hearing at court, it will be necessary to request court the indication of a public sworn translator. Therefore, we kindly request you to inform us, up till May 21st, 2001, if such will be needed so that we may take the necessary measures in this regard in time. We do clarify, however, that we find it unnecessary the attendance of a foreign company representative in the extent that Ms. Daniele Cunha, who attended the first hearing at court, has shown enough and necessary knowledge in order to function as company representative at the present case. At last, please advise as to whom shall the legal fees billing related to this case be addressed to. Please contact us should you need any further clarification on the above.

A new business unit, Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which will include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Production Corporation (NEPCO). Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, as Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services. NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under John Gillis, President. With the majority of EE&CC and OEC's activities focused on assets and projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the efforts of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports. While EEOS will be a stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports. This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects. Consistent with this approach, Development Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units which they support. With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design, construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron's assetson a global basis. This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world. Please join us in congratulating Brian and Keith on their new assignments. Mark Frevert & Dave Delainey"

He's come up with a percentage, according to how many total people he orders for, then according to how many people are in each group, and he charges each cost center accordingly. I've attached the 2 worksheets that he's provided me, which are for June and July, however there were fewer people in our group because since then he has added Brian Redmond and his group to our budget. Daniel is working on preparing the spreadsheets for August and September. I've told Ina that I'm needing them for a project for you, so I'm sure that they will be ready soon. I thought that I could just look at what's been charged to our cost center each month, but it was too difficult to figure out which invoices were from which lunch because they don't always hit the cost center the month during or after they were invoiced. They are also sometimes charged on a credit card and then billed in a huge lump sum. I've simply made a spreadsheet showing selected restaurants and the average price of what we've been charged for June and July, and then I've shown what it will cost for 15 people to eat if we order it separately.

Well, its finally ready to roll out, just in time for your light weekend reading!! Currently the Steel Group confirms short term deals using a 12 page GTC and the Forest Products Group confirms deals using a 1 1/2 page GTC. The attached unified form GTC represents a compromise between Steel and Forest Product; that is, its length is a miniscule 5 1/2 pages (excluding the Claims Procedure Appendices). Aside for shrinking the Steel GTC and lengthening the Forest Products GTC, the new EIM GTC addressed parties' contracting rights if a Trade Event involving the imposition of trade duties or import/export restrictions messes up the economics of a Transaction. As you all know, imports of Steel and Lumber into the U.S. are very sensitive issues that the Commerce Department, President and Congress are currently assessing and will act on within the next 5 months. Legal has taken feedback and used it to craft a bilateral arrangement that acknowledges the effect of Trade Events. Please let us know if this bilateral approach works for you. The new EIM GTC addresses, in greater detail, how parties must proceed making claims as to defective products (i.e., a Defect Claim). While I have received helpful suggestions from Del Davis and John Daniel, this area is the one that varies the most widely between Steel and Forest Products (as well as within the various commodities offered by such Groups). Therefore it is the area that needs the most input and work from logistics, insurance and others that deal with these types of problems. Keep in mind that any solutions you make should have a bilateral slant to them, as EIM will be both a Buyer and a Seller. Too hard a position taken either way will come back to haunt us. But please give me your input in this area--the pertinent sections are 6.1(c) and the 2 Appendices attached at the end. If we need more specialized Appendices for other Commodities, please provide me details for same. Legal would like the Documentation Group to make a mass mailing of the new EIM GTC to all current and former customers next week and start using the new GTC late next week, if possible. I remain available to take your comments, typo fixes, suggested changes, deletions, additions, etc. with the goal of finalizing this document by the end of the day next Tuesday. Please help me to meet that deadline by reviewing the attached as soon as possible.

        "content": "ETS Risk System Rod, Caroline forwarded me your questions regarding the Risk System so I wanted to go ahead and respond since Steve is out this week. I don't think Philippe requires the level of due diligence that we performed, but we were getting questioned on buying a 3rd party product vs. using an Enron Risk System. We did more research and got the other groups involved so that they would understand our decision. I believe everyone is now comfortable with our purchase decision. In our analysis of systems, we selected the Caminus product in part because we had several individual references from Arthur Andersen, Deliotte &Touche and Ernst & Young. These organizations, especially Arthur Andersen, have audited this application and have actually participated in numerous implementations. Ernst & Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable Resources. Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or 6 other companies, and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for Tractabel. After talking with individuals from these accounting firms, we felt very confident that the product was sound, and we should not have audit concerns. Obviously, we have a lot of business procedures that have to be established, and there is time in the work plan to do that work, but a lot of those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes. Regarding costs, we have an approved work order for $650,000 which covers all the initial hardware, software, implementation costs and first year maintenance. This cost does represent a very limited implementation with only 10 concurrent users, no customization except a few reports, and no electronic interfaces or data conversion. The assumption is that initially the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost justified, and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as well. The on-going costs are estimated at approximately $100,000/year. We did not perform a separate cost/benefit analysis as this was in the original cost of the Revenue Management RAROC. Let me know if you have any other questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to completing the contract. We are hoping to get this signed and the project underway next week. Thanks. "

The information we got was right on target and Meg and I came back with full notebooks and bulging heads. It was a very useful and productive trip from our point of view, and we very much appreciated your very professional organization of the process. Having worked on the drafts over the last couple of weeks, we have come to the conclusion that the material is just too rich to fit into a single case. In dividing our story into two parts, we focused our first case on the transformational story that unfolded during the 1990s, not only on the strategic changes occurring within the company but also on the organizational and managerial redesign that supported and drove those new directions. The second case will encapsulate some of that company background, but will focus in more detail on the way in which the new Enron environment sparked the Enron Online innovation. I have used this approach a couple of times previously, focusing on entrepreneurship at 3M and on human resource management at Microsoft, and for your information I will forward copies of those two-part cases as models of what we are working towards. The other thing I wanted to update you on was our plans to make these cases as interactive as possible. Given Enron's transition into the \"new economy\" and particularly the focus of the Enron Online case, we feel it is very important to develop these cases in a multimedia manner. This means that we will try to provide links to video material, Websites, streamed interviews, etc. wherever they can support the development of the story line. The videos you sent us following our last visit are a very good starting point, but we should probably try to schedule videotaped interviews with Jeff Skilling, Ken Lay, and Louise Packard for sometime in the near future -- certainly before Christmas. Thanks again for all your help and support in getting us this far. Our hope is that we can get some drafts to you over the next couple of weeks for your review and input. Meanwhile, Meg will be contacting you to see if we can set up a day for the videotaped interviews. We are greatly looking forward to completing our work on this very exciting project.

        "content": "Re: FERC Presentation It is my understanding that Enron Gov't Affaits would like us to use the FERC visits to make the case that the wholesale gas markets are very liquid and competitive, while wholesale electric markets are not -- largely because the FERC has not fully unbundled electric transmission. FERC should be spending 90% of its time fixing fundamental structural rules in the electric side and 10% refining rules on the gas side. That is not to say that there aren't important revisions that the FERC should take up on the gas side. These fixes, however, can be characterized as refinements, as contrasted with the fundamental changes we seek on the electric side. Moreover, these changes may largely be addressed by the recent Order 637. With respect to E-commerce, I believe that the Enron message is that the FERC should fix the structural problems and get out of the way - e-commerce will come and in most cases is already here. Dave Forster of EnronOnLine will be making a presentation that focuses on how much more liquid gas is than power, as evidenced by tight spreads. In previous presentations to FERC folks, Steve Kean has made the point that while the rules are far from perfect on the gas side (i.e. tariffs are still not standardized), the market works because FERC got the basic structural rules right (i.e. 636 unbundling). I think all your areas of improvement are appropriate (of course I don't necessarily like them as a pipeliner), but I think they fit the overall Enron message if presented as a list of refinements. I plan to speak to them about competitive pressures our pipeline face, our current web sites, plans for Order 637 postings and intraday capacity release. Here are my thoughts on getting your points across within the overall theme. I'm also sending out a separate email outline of the day. "

The transaction has continued to develop along the lines of my last update of 11-21-00. The terms and economics remain essentially as outlined on 11-21-00. In summary, the primary form of consideration will be a derivative-like commodity agreement or a 'contract for differences'. This contract will be exchanged in full for the SubNotes and the majority of our equity interest. The JEDI II equity interest will also receive a residual contingent interest which will become payable in the event of a PPA restructuring at the Linden facility. We are calling the derivative a swap but it is more like a receivable. An El Paso affiliate (guaranteed by El Paso as parent) will notionally be paying NYMEX plus approx $0.52 (escalating) over seven years on a notional volume of 300,000 MMBtu/d and receiving NYMEX. With netting the contract is simply a series of fixed quarterly payments over seven years. No offset rights and no limitations on the guarantee - fully a stand alone agreement. We are optimistic that we may be able to sign documents as early as Thursday night. This agreement can be terminated at our option in the event that we do not receive the necessary internal approvals. There are only two significant external approvals required, a NJ Environmental 'non-applicability' determination and ECP credit ratings reaffirmation. Accordingly we expect at this time to receive the necessary internal and external approvals and close by year end. We expect that a public announcement would be appropriate at the time both parties have received all necessary internal approvals. The portion of the commodity contract being exchanged for the SubNotes is expected to be offered to Condor to monetize this portion of the contract at year end. Subsequent to Condor's acquisition of its contract, both JEDI II's contract and the Condor contract are expected to be monetized in a QSPE vehicle later in the first quarter. Please call or email with any questions you may have. Thanks for your assistance in these matters."

One transaction was with Coral Energy Holding L.P. and three transactions were with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. As mutually agreed to by both the Enron commercial team and the respective counterparties, it was decided that each of the four transactions would not be confirmed and should be terminated. The exact specifics are detailed as follows: ? The transactions occurred due to an inadvertent entry in the actual production system of EnronOnline by a Product Control Group member, Melba Lozano. Melba activated a product assuming that she was in the EnronOnline test system of EnronOnline. ? The product transacted upon is normally managed by Frank Ermis. However, in his absence on Friday, the product was managed by Matt Lenhart. ? Steve South, trader on the West Desk, called and notified both Morgan and Coral that the product had been posted in error. All parties agreed that the transactions were not reflective of the normal pricing. As a result they further agreed that transaction confirmations would not be necessary and that the deals would be \"killed\" on all sides. (For reference of any telephone tapes that may need to be pulled, the conversations with the counterparties occurred around 2:00 pm.) ? No confirmations were generated as a result of the killing of the transactions in TAGG. ? I spoke with Mike Grigsby on Monday (April 23, 2001) and advised him that termination letters may be required by Legal. He responded that he had no problem with that.

I was able to find a summary of the November 15-16, 2000 Emerging Issues Task Force meeting discussing the \"best efforts\" language in increasing the authorized shares. I would propose revising the stricken language in 3(a) to read as follows: \"In the event that, but for this Section 3, titled \"Other Provisions,\" Party B would be obligated to deliver a number of Shares equal to the Determined Amount plus the Excess Shares, Party B shall have an ongoing obligation to satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares; provided however that the number of Excess Shares to be delivered hereby shall not exceed [________] shares. Party B may, at its sole option, satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares by using its best efforts to increase its Authorized Shares or by delivery of a cash payment equal to the [product obtained by multiplying the Excess Shares by the Final Price].\" Please confirm that the formula for the cash payment is appropriate. Their language puts a cap on the number of shares to be delivered but that cap is tied to a value making the number of shares to be delivered indeterminate and therefor outside your control. The cap drafted above solves this problem. It is important to note that no interest can accrue while Party B is waiting to get approval to increase its authorized shares, if so the obligation would be accounted for as debt. _________________ Beth Ann Dranguet Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.

Resolutions of sole member of Salmon Energy LLC authorizing the turbine acquisition and related documents; 2. Incumbency Certificate of ENA for the escrow agent; and 3. Incumbency Certificate of PPL for the escrow agent. The resolutions authorize the turbine contract, the loan from PPL, and the G/E consent and agreement. I have also drafted resolutions to be dated the day following closing to elect as directors the persons named in the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement (need the names of these persons - three designees of PPL and one designee of ENA) and to replace the officers of the LLC with persons designated by PPL. If the lender desires Salmon resolutions authorizing a security agreement to be signed by Salmon, we would recommend that the new Salmon board controlled by PPL sign resolutions ratifying and approving the security agreement, rather than have ENA approve a security agreement that it has not negotiated and is not familiar with. From a timing standpoint, we need to focus on the documentation required to set up the escrow account, as I understand that the escrow may be funded on the same day as the financial closing, namely, Thursday, April 19. Citibank will need (I) the escrow agreement, (ii) an incumbency certificate from each party to the escrow agreement, (iii) a W-9 signed by each non-corporate party to the escrow agreement, and (iv) a signed fee agreement. The incumbency certificates are enclosed. Please insert names and other information as appropriate. We need comments to the Escrow Agreement in as soon as possible in order that we can provide these documents to Citibank for approval. Thank you. Carolyn M.

For the past several months,a project team, representing Enron's temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team's efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition. We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001. The scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two phases have been completed. Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we selected CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group based on their exceptional management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our staffing needs. The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective and simple means for obtaining temporary employees. In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group will be communicating to Enron's administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors about the new process. There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are outlined on the attached page. More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed Services team. What is Managed Services? CORESTAFF's Managed Services program includes: ? Vendor-neutral management model ? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners ? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized reporting ? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement ? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies Key Benefits ? More vendors working on each order from the outset =01) faster access to available talent pools ? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively ? Online access to requisition status for users ?

        "content": " JSKILLIN (Non-Privileged).pst Hi Jeff. I hope you are enjoying the challenge of running Enron in the midst of all the excitement and change in the energy industry. I want to bring to your attention an issue that affects me quite directly in my new role as CEO of TransElect, an independent electric transmission company. I think it also affects Enron in a very significant way. The National Grid has applied to the FERC for a declaratory order that would permit the Grid to operate the Alliance RTO (this is a Midwest RTO that includes AEP, Exelon, DTE, CMS, First Energy and Dominion). I believe quite strongly that FERC should deny this petition because the Grid is a significant owner of both distribution and generation assets in the Northeast (New England Electric and Niagara Mohawk). It is a very small step from this decision to one that would allow Southern to operate GridSouth, or one that would allow Entergy to operate the Florida RTO in exchange for FP&L operating the Entergy RTO. As a matter of National policy, transmission operators should be independent of either the wholesale or retail electric markets. As a business issue, many transmission owners are reluctant to divest of transmission because they retain hope that their transmission can be used to protect above market native generation. How would you like to try shipping power into the Northeast with the Grid, a major retail supplier and a significant generator, controlling access to the market? I think it is important that the FERC give the Grid a \"no\" on the request for permission. It is even more important that the issue be decided by the \"new FERC\". There is a disturbing indication that the outgoing chairman might okay this request on his way out the door. I urge you to intervene as a way to both slow down the freight train and as a way to get the right answer out of FERC. If you or your General Counsel would like more information, give me a call at 503 636-7134, or call my General Counsel, Al Statman, at 202 393-1200. Thanks for considering the issue, and best wishes for continued success. Fred Buckman"

Intergen is holding a Board meeting this afternoon and the proposed transaction is on the agenda for approval.

Once the assignment documents are ready for execution, Intergen will fund the transaction and Enron will execute the assignment documents immediately after receiving written confirmation that Enron has received the transaction proceeds.

Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington. Paragraph 13 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) provides that either party may terminate the OBA \"at the end of the primary term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice\" to Burlington. (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since gone month-to-month.) 2. On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington. The 12/31/92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term. This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02. However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement \"may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event the OBA between the parties is terminated.\" As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh our other options first.

The following matrix is structured so as to show a link between these goals and the recommended regulatory action: Note: I think our focus on the current valuation processes is over-emphasized. I think it doubtful that the contentious valuation process that is already underway in the regulatory arena will be circumvented or brought forward in time because of current cash-flow problems.

        "content": " KLAY (Non-Privileged).pst As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron. The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry. Thank you.

If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our customers. The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think. 3. The spreads out West have been huge this summer. We were able to take advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very difficult time. 4. When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on management duties. 5. Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day off. She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several different jobs at a time. 6.

You have a good hand on the legal issues for the employment matters. If a form of indemnity is required, make it very broad to cover all risks, including, but not limited to, selection, unlawful discrimination and for permitting tortuous interference with employment. I assume that you have received my November 1 memo regarding Bidder D. Redlined SPA. I listened in on the labor relations call yesterday, but there didn't seem to be anything for me to comment on. I do have one observation about the call. While I don't know anything about the transaction, the conversation about employment and benefits would have been facilitated if Enron had previously submitted a written schedule of all of the documents and information Enron required in completing its due diligence review, and used that written schedule to make reference to the data that has not yet been received. Enron should not let the other side's data schedule or lack of a complete schedule control Enron's due diligence agenda. Enron should know in advance what information it wants and use a check off sheet to manage the due diligence process. That way, the other side will better understand what Enron expectations are. I use this kind of data management tool all of the time and it is very helpful to be able to refer to when it was presented to the other side, how long they have had it and what items are still missing. I heard nothing like that in the conference call yesterday. It was though people were thinking of things as the conversation went along. Pat "

        "content": " Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas. Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30. We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy. While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses. The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy. It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts. We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas. Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services. Ken Dear ETS Colleague: On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy. In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas. Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved. The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court. For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business. Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas. Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS. Keep up the good work! Stan"

A new business unit, Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which will include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Production Corporation (NEPCO). Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, as Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services. NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under John Gillis, President. With the majority of EE&CC and OEC's activities focused on assets and projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the efforts of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports. While EEOS will be a stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports. This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects. Consistent with this approach, Development Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units which they support. With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design, construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron's assetson a global basis. This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world. Please join us in congratulating Brian and Keith on their new assignments. Mark Frevert & Dave Delainey"

We already have a Qwest Representative assigned to us for CO and UT. A letter will go out Monday (Mar 19) for SBC for TX and IL. Letters will be drafted for PA, DC, NY, NJ and MA for Verizon and will go out within the next week. We expect to have a letter go out to Bell South for GA, FL and LA early next week as well. We are meeting with counsel for SBC-CA and NV and expect to send a letter for CA early next week. The letter for NV will go out the following week, as our CLEC filing will be delayed one week. The only other state where we need to check with Verizon about how they wish to proceed is VA, as the licensing process is expected to take longer and Verizon may not negotiate with us until we are closer to receiving approval. We will update that information early next week. Review of Interconnection Agreements/Meeting with Outside Counsel Lara and I will be meeting with all of our outside counsel over the next two weeks to review agreements that they have forwarded to us and to identify agreements as candidates for opt-in. We would like to review the results of those meetings with the negotiating team on April 2 and present the opt-in candidates. Please indicate your availability for a luncheon meeting. I would expect the meeting to take up to three hours. After that meeting, we hope to have identified the contracts that we will use to negotiate interconnection agreements with the ILECs for purposes of opting-in. With the assistance of Eric Benson, GA, we are putting together a database that will identify the pros/cons of the agreements that we are reviewing. It will be available to the team on the EBS Government Affairs website. This will be a tool for internal review as well as charting the progress of our negotiations on issues with the ILECs. Addition to the GA Interconnection Negotiation Team In addition to Lara and me, John Neslage will be joining the EBS Government Affairs negotiating team. John has been part of the Risk Analytics group, determining risk exposure to EES/ENA/EBS for entering into particular deals. John is an attorney with experience with Enron International. His background and expertise will be a valuable addition to our team. State Approval of Opt-In Agreements A question was raised about whether or not we needed to have explicit state commission approval of an opt-in agreement that has been executed by the CLEC and the ILEC. Most states do have a process for accepting such contracts, however, it does not always require an act of the state commission to become a valid contract. Some states have a protest period, after which time, if no one raises an objection, the agreement is passively approved. Oregon, for example, has a 16-day protest period. If no one protests the agreement within 16 days, the agreement is approved. If someone does protest, the state has upto 90 days to issue a decision. As part of the negotiation with the ILEC, we can request that we begin operation immediately. This is a matter of practice versus process. While we technically do need to go through the normal process for approval before the agreement is valid, we can, on an unofficial basis, begin to operate as though the agreement were approved. This is done because there is a low likelihood that a protest will be filed against the agreement. We would want to maintain a low profile about such mutual agreements as certain state commissions may take exception to such practices. The only other caution would be that if any disputes were to arise prior to official state commission approval, we would not have recourse to complain to the state commission about the ILEC's behavior. While the states have up to 90 days to approve an agreement, unless they have provisions such as OR, we have been advised that most approvals will occur within 30 days. "

In a subsequent Procedural Ruling, the ALJ asked parties for more specific questions and detailed sub-issues under the 5 major issues. As a result, there were over 200 questions/issues submitted to the Staff. Concerned that it would be difficult to answer all the questions in any meaningful way and submit for Commission decision by the August deadline, Staff proposes to phase-in the proceeding by focusing on issues 1 and 5 first so the utilities can begin the embedded cost studies. The remaining issues will be addressed some time after August. On a conference call held yesterday (May 21st), utilities expressed their strong feeling that all 5 issues needed to be answered before any study could be started while ESCOs sided with the Staff. Staff will submit its phasing-in proposal to the ALJ in the May 25 Prehearing Conference and is ready to issue guidelines as to how costs should be classified and allocated to different functions. Enron is an active party to the proceeding stand-alone and also through our membership in NESPA. Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information. Stella"

The Faribault branchline is currently being odorized by NSP per a previous arrangement in order to comply with a commitment NNG made to the DOT to transport odorized gas because of the population density along the pipeline. There is no threat of a by pass by selling these branchlines. There is an estimated annual O&M savings of $10k to $20k plus the avoided expense, exposure and operational headaches of not having to monitor high pressure branchline odorization. The net book value of these facilities is $57,712. The facilities will be sold for $1. In addition, NSP has agreed to enter into a 1 year transportation agreement guaranteeing incremental revenues of $350,000. The net book value of the facilities, is assumed to be of such small value as to be de minimus as allowed by previous rulings of the Commission and will be treated as a non-operating unit. This will allow the undepreciated balance to be cleared to depreciation reserves. The sale will require that the Northfield TBS be relocated upstream of the main line take off at an estimated cost of $225,000. David "

        "content": " vkamins.nsf Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects which have been implemented with current EES customers. The Scope of Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to its customers based on their industry segment. The projects and services offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of deployment varies significantly from segment to segment. Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would feature similar assets and services. SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers that comprise each segment. The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs. This project list represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried from PCCS. The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM. Generally those activities have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs, Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly. Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all assets. Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real estate segment. Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation product. I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting. Would like to see the meeting take place late next week. Thanks. Richard "

My immediate thoughts are as follows. Obviously, you should keep the discussions entirely to problems experienced with B.C. Hydro/Powerex foreclosure of transmission capacity. If the project proceeds, the coalititon should appoint a limited number of people to carry the project and report back to participants. The working group should ensure that their proceedings include outside counsel who had or have some knowledge of antitrust, as well as the regulatory issues. The coalition should stay as close as possible to government. For example, they should try to involve Alberta officials in the project if possible. My guess is the Competition Bureau will take the view that regulatorys (B.C., NEB, FERC) have primary jurisdiction, but the Bureau may be an ally in dealing with regulators. Do you know who at the Bureau TransAlta talked to about their concerns? This may also have some bearing on the extent to which Enron should openly participate in the project. - TEXT.htm"

So, Gerald, unless you have some objection that we have overlooked, I believe it is appropriate to remove the words \"or open season\" in the product description. Regarding the GTC, since we were planning on eliminating Paragraph 3 anyway, which had the open season reference, I think that one is already taken care of.

To expedite matters, these revised drafts are being sent to you before review by InterGen with the understanding that InterGen may have additional changes and comments. In addition to changes necessitated by the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas, the letter agreements have been revised to reflect the following requirements of InterGen: (i) The parent guaranty on behalf of Sweetgum Energy LP has been deleted; (ii) A mutual covenant requiring the Parties to use all reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent as been added to the end of Section 3; and (iii) A no shop clause on the part of ENA and its affiliates has been added as a new Section 17. The reference to the TRY Ventures International agreement was deleted from the letter agreement relating to the ABB transformer since it is my understanding that the ABB transformer was not covered by Coral's agreement with TRY.

Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in exchange for our providing similar information to them. He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own equipment. As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover the period of September of 1999 to the end of October. The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999. With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim of privilege to all of the tapes. The Bureau has now come back to us and has asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question. We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in time, they have not responded to us. If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only. How this particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear. Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the flavour of the matter to our benefit. On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau. We will advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between Powerex and Enron.

        "content": " dfossum.nsf Either I didn't fully understand the December Texas Eastern order or else FERC has just put a new and unhelpful spin on it. The Thursday rehearing order dramatically changes how the \"shipper must have title\" rule applies to acquisitions of upstream capacity. I thought the Dec. order pretty clearly allowed a pipe to acquire upstream capacity and then resell that capacity under the acquiring pipeline's rate schedules. FERC specifically held that the \"shipper must have title\" policy won't be applied if the acquiring pipe treats the acquired capacity \"as though it were part of its own system\". (p. 61,886) The Dec. order even cited TW's acquisition of park n ride capacity from PG&E as an example of the type of transaction that (I thought) could be done without advance Commission approval. Now, FERC explains that it did not intend a \"blanket waiver\" of the shipper must have title policy. Pipes can still acquire upstream capacity without advance FERC permission, but only if the acquiring pipe is going to use the acquired capacity for operational needs or to resell under the selling pipe's release mechanism. If the acquiring pipe wants to use the acquired capacity to support sales of service under the acquiring pipe's rate schedules, a specific waiver of the \"must have title\" policy is required (see FN 20 and text). We are right back to where we started. I guess the orders signal that FERC is much more likely to grant waivers of the \"must have title\" policy than in the past, but I don't think we are good to go to acquire upstream storage, for example, and resell it as FDD or IDD until we get permission first. Shelley--let me know if you hear any expressions of outrage from other pipes. This might be worth chasing on rehearing since it is such a clear about face by FERC. "

This invitation is extended to anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past two years. These informal, interactive forums will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year. Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues. They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, create a =01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron's executive management is on the=01&same page=018 about where Enron is going---and why. To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions: Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below. You will attend only one session.) ______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M ______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work: ? Each session will have approximately 20 participants. ? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue. ? This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations. ? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions. ? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum. ? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc. Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing, as to what session you will attend. We will try to honor requests for first choices as much as possible. Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com). Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806. Thank you. "

I want to share some constructive advice on how to fine tune our strategy with respect to scheduling because Keegan this is critical to my providing the best legal counsel I can to the various clients we serve. You indicated that there is a conflict on the schedule in that there is a 9:30-10:30 meeting that conflicts with the Swaps Group meeting. We do not want to schedule conflicting meetings and then realize it at the last minute and then just notify one group that we can't attend. What you want to do is this: You want to try at the time of the invitation to attend or as soon as practicable to notify me that there would be a potential conflict. Then I will try to rescheduel. This is especially important because the meetings with GSS are usually with folks from outside Enron, so once we agree to attend, it is nearly impossible the morning before to try to reschedule. But the swaps meetings and credit meetings are very important and there are a lot of issues I need to discuss and anticipated attending. Also and I have missed some in the past due to scheduling conflicts. Again, I also hope and need for you to take this advice constructively and not personally.

        "content": " mmcconn.nsf I was in Spain with the Credit Department to receive a list of assets and supporting documentation from GMP that they were to prepare to convince Enron the company had a chance to make it through its present difficulties. The overall situation is that this business has ground to a halt. They are a distribution company without any supplies or suppliers willing to supply them on open credit and no bank lines. Thus they are making no sales and have no cash coming into the business. They are owed 12 mil dollars presently from their customers for previous deliveries. They are unlikely to recover this outstanding receivable without a resumption of deliveries. The above reflects the situation that we were working with GMP to improve with the thought that their outstanding debt was appx 30 million dollars. The situation this week we found out was considerably worse. They disclosed that they had not paid the Spanish tax authorities since September the vat taxes they collect on the government behalf. 25 mil usd is the amount of overdue taxes and that number will continue to increase depending on the rate of interest they are charged and the penalties imposed upon them for their default. Given the debt is to the tax authorities this poses further difficulties. The tax authorities have preferential rights over all other creditors There is no time bar that limits the time period that the courts can look back to quantify when a company became effectively bankrupt can be absolved as not legitimate. The payments we received since September (50 million) could therefore be viewed by the courts as money that should have been paid by GMP to other creditors. Looking through the records some of this payments were for cargoes being delivered in that time (appx 18 mil) but the majority (32 mil) was the paying down of previous debt. Our existing debt situation is as follows: 5 mil unsecured debt on oil sold to GMP 13 mil unsecured debt on mark to market exposure. Four vessels were delivered over November and December by Enron to Ectric Spain that priced to GMP over the month of delivery. GMP was to prepay this oil to Enron as they lifted the product. We entered this arrangement to try and keep them operating and also allow them to meet their strategic stock requirements. Our risks under a claw back by the courts for preferential payment while GMP insolvent: 20 million in strategic stocks (this oil was initially sold by Enron to GMP and then the title was passed by GMP to Ectric Spain when GMP was in default on the payment). Concern here being that if the courts declared GMP bankrupt at the time that the title was transferred that transaction could be declared null and void. Enron would have to liquidate the physical oil and the proceeds divided amongst all the creditors. ?? million on money received by Enron in preference to the other creditors. The main concern here is the 25 million owed to the tax authorities. The debt of the other suppliers and banks is as follows: veba 15 mil. total 3 mil. vitol 1 mil. deutche bank 10 mil. we don't feel that there is a significant case of preferential treatment to us vs these other suppliers. Actions we are taking going forward. 1) Speaking with Veba about insisting on a professional liquidation practitioner being hired as a precondition for any further support. 2) We are in the process of selling all the oil that we hold in Spain. We want to eliminate the possibility of the courts putting a freeze on the oil we have in Spain in the event of bankruptcy. We will continue to pressure this company to refinance their company. In March 2000 we conducted a detailed review of their books and they were worth 5 mil usd. We don't believe that the business has lost money anywhere near the level of present indebtedness and actually would have expected 2000 to have been a profitable business environment for them. Thus, it is our conclusion that they have been taking money out of the company. I will update you further on what if any assets they do bring forward to improve this outlook. David/Robert please add in where you feel I've left out anything important. Thanks, Chris. "

This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures, feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR. Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces. The scope includes a review of the processes which impact the accuracy of information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process. They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications. The projected timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days. We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips. This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available: 1) the ability to track data \"accuracy\" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique \"failures\". How complete is the data? 2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?) 3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows 4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.

The \"Hub & Spoke\" analysis is an appropriate method for determining the ability of a market participant to exercise market power in transmission. Market based rate applications for transmission-owning utilities merit the same level of scrutiny as that given to merger applications, i.e., a competitive screening analysis followed by a more detailed behavioral analysis whenever the screen reveals potential market power. Modernizing this type of market power analysis required with market based rate applications is of equal importance to that of improving the analysis for merger applications, as recognized by the Commission in its recent Filing Requirements Rulemaking, Order No. 642, Revised Filing Requirements Under Part 33 of the Commission's Regulations, 93 F.E.R.C. ? 61,164, 65 Fed.

Haedicke FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net Corporation HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm With everything in the \"Wexis\" universe always just a click or two away on the Internet, you no longer need to pick and choose resources and interestingly, you no longer necessarily require expensive subscriptions. Before the Internet you couldn't Shepardize for $4 or Keycite(r) for $3.75. You had to be a subscriber. Today all you need is a credit card. See, e.g.: http://www.westlaw.com/SubOptions/other.wl see also: http://web.lexis.com/xchange/Forms/uas/Catalog.asp In fact, everything published to http://www.westlaw.com and http://www.lexis.com is available on-demand whenever you cannot quickly find the right answer elsewhere for free, or for short money using TheLaw.net. Why is this significant and why would we advertise our competitors? Simple. For years, the management question has been whether to make that onerous annual commitment to Company A or Company B. But thanks to the Internet, you can have just what you need, at the precise time you need it on a pay-per-view basis. Choosing the right tool for the job is the trick. But that's easy once you know your options. --USEFUL BELLS AND WHISTLES OR TEDIOUS OVERKILL? TheLaw.net Custom Browser lacks some of Wexis' bells and whistles. For instance, using our meta-searchable database of four million plus Federal and state appellate judicial opinions, you can quickly call up a relevant list of cases that have construed the statute, rule, reg or cite that you need to learn more about. It is just as easy to quickly jump to the relevant excerpt of each case to assess relevancy. What's missing are the little colored arrows indicating whether a Court followed or distinguished your case. For some, the lack of every conceivable enhancement can be a deal breaker. Others, however, prefer to draw their own conclusions by checking cases for themselves because at some point in their career something happened which caused them to question whether the best lawyers are the ones still writing headnotes. Depending on the job at hand, the mind numbing array of costly, high falutin' Wexis icons and symbols scattered throughout a document, may be very useful or very confusing and unnecessary. --THE INTERNET: AN INCUBATOR FOR CHOICE We advertise our competitors because we recognize that Wexis has been a work in progress for generations and we know that you will probably always have a relationship with them at some level; subscription, pay-per-view, or otherwise. Certainly, factors such as practice area, jurisdiction, organization size and culture all contribute to assembling what is, for you, the best matrix of tools for the job. Far be it from us to say precisely where we fit in. This, by definition, is an individualized decision only you can make as a sophisticated consumer of information services. Experience teaches, however, that by deploying TheLaw.net in your world: ----you may discover that your online productivity increases ten fold ----the list of expensive subscription items may be much shorter ----you may discover that it makes sense to use Wexis only a transaction basis We have subscribers who will tell you that this is a great way to run a business. Clients' expectations are set at the front end. You recover 100% of your costs on the back side and the embarrassment of finessing or eating unanticipated charges are added to what we hope is a long list of learning experiences. See, e.g., http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm General practitioners frequently see us as a sensible, low flat-rate go-to resource and when necessary, they supplement with Wexis. Specialists sometimes choose to cling to their elegant practice or jurisdiction specific slice of Wexis, adding us on as \"meter insurance\" for those occasions when The Plan doesn't cut. All seem to recognize that TheLaw.net has indeed developed the definitive best practices software solution for getting around online; a solution that allows you to instantly begin leveraging tens of thousands of critical web based documents and databases on behalf of your online enterprise. --A FIRM FOUNDATION AT A LOW, FLAT-RATE --------$395 annually for you --------$575 for you and a partner --------$1195 for your five-user workgroup --------Unlimited access to everything we have --------30-Day Unconditional Money Back Guarantee --------Enterprise Licenses are also available.

We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

        "content": "Revisiting Annual Elections for Domestic Entities With the goals of (i) getting the corporate database as up to date as possible; and (ii) increasing the efficiency of the Corporate Services department, I would like to suggest the following changes: Given the constant restructuring of Enron there are usually several major projects in the works to change the slates of directors and/or officers. As we are handling approximately 2,500 active legal entities, it takes a great deal of time to sort out the details, handle the data entry, prepare the election consents for your review and signature line initials, and circulate for signature.. However, if we take domestic annual elections out of the equation we can solve one problem area relatively easily. As you are aware the domestic annual election project is a very large undertaking both for the Corporate Services group, and for the various legal groups. Historically, it's been a time for the operating groups to review the slates of directors, officers, and attorneys-in-fact, make changes, review again, make more changes, until the final unanimous written consent resolutions are produced, initialled, and signed by the directors or stockholder(s) - a frustrating process that has frequently taken many months to complete. I'd like to recommend to you that we reduce the annual elections to a more \"administrative\" function, i.e. the annual election of directors only (as required by state law). I'm suggesting that we re-elect the existing directors as of a specified date (within 13 months of the previous annual election to conform to state law), the consents are prepared, sent for your review and initials, signed by shareholder(s), and placed in the minute books, and the project is over! All other changes to the director and officer slates, and attorney-in-fact appointments are submitted by you to us in the normal course of business throughout the year. We'll send you annually the familiar slates of directors, officers, and attorneys-in-fact for your review, but the pressure on you and on us to respond to a specific election date is removed. You review the slates, discuss them within your operating groups, and choose your own date for resignations and elections, entirely separate from the annual election of directors function. I look forward to discussing this with you and/or your staff, and I'm open to any comments and suggestions that you might have. What worked well historically has become a nightmare for all concerned and it's time to open the box and re-examine the contents now, before we start all over again in June 2001! If I don't hear from you I'll assume that you agree with this suggested new format and you won't hear from us on this subject until June 2001. Best regards Kate Kate B.

From: Joseph Carrico [Joseph.Carrico@ib.bankgesellschaft.de] To: Schuyler Henderson Re: Response to your remarks of 7 September. Dear Schuyler, I would like respond to your mail concerning the ISDA Protocol. Concerning Annex 3:- I concur with your observations that in many lending and repo master agreements there are events of default that are of another nature than the events which are Events of Default under the ISDA. These events include, for example, being suspended from an exchange (which may be relevant as an event of default with respect to securities in a specific market, but was very likely not foreseen by the parties to the ISDA as an Event of Default under the broader product coverage of the ISDA). In addition, in the proposed ?5(a)(v)(2) there is a similar cross pollution issue with respect to delivery failures. When reviewing the many master agreements where under physical delivery of shares or bonds are foreseen there is little consistency with respect to the treatment of delivery failures. ISDA documented products have the possibility to be covered by Failure to Deliver provisions, some agreements provide for a mini-default/close-out, some try to bring in a cash element as a test for proving a counterparty's liquidity (often a termination event approach) , and others offer the option of a mini-close-out or a total default, and yet other documents offer only a total default. Given the regularity these failures occur in the market, I have drafted a version of Annex 3, which also addresses this issue by building into the provisions a procedure (a shortened version of the Failure to Deliver provision used in ISDA's 1997 Government Bond Option Definitions) whereby the counterparty is given the opportunity to prove its liquidity. I attach the annex I have prepared addressing these issues. Annex 8:- Concerning Early Termination Date and Section 6, you raise very interesting issues, which I confess I had not focused on before in that light. I agree with your analysis that with the effective date of the notice being the true termination date of the Transactions with the Early Termination Date being more a valuation date. My view is that this is an opportune time to discuss the issues you raise in more detail given the broad scope of the up coming Master Agreement Protocol. I attach the alternative proposal for Annex 3. Would you please forward this response to the broader documentation committee, as I am unable to do so from my computer because I did not receive the original e-mail due to the length of the header on the e-mail.

        "content": "SEC Timing Mark and Dwight, You've asked us to outline a strategy for getting the SEC order by year-end. The first issue is to get rid of the intervenors. If we can tell the SEC staff that we are settling with TANC and SMUD and the Nevada Commission, we can ask them to focus again on the substantive issues. As you know, there are two major issues: (i) the integration, which we believe we have more or less under control, and (ii) the capital structure of the resulting system, which is dependent in the first instance on the timing of the Sierra auction. Concerning integration, the question is whether Sierra's \"blended approach\" (that is, a 50 MW long-term firm path between PGE and Nevada Power and a combination of nonfirm and short-term firm linking Sierra to the rest of the system) is beyond current SEC precedent. In AEP and Xcel, the SEC found that a long-term firm path was sufficient to establish that two parts of a system were \"physically interconnected or capable of interconnection.\" Although Xcel also involved the use of a nonfirm path, that was on an interim basis, pending the completion of certain upgrades necessary for the firm contract path. Absent some statement to the contrary, it is our understanding that the staff would not approve the \"blended approach\" by delegated authority. There is, however, an alternative approach to integration under which we would ask the SEC staff to find that PGE and Nevada were integrated and that Sierra constituted a permissible \"additional\" system under the (A)(B)(C) clauses of Section 11(b)(1). Sierra has completed the studies needed to justify this approach. Based on conversations with Bob Wason and Cathey Baker on the SEC staff, we believe that this approach could be approved by delegated authority. Concerning the capital structure of the resulting system, there is a perception on the part of the staff that Sierra is significantly overextended. As you know, the SEC generally requires registered holding companies to maintain a minimum of 30% common equity. While there is precedent to support a floor of 27.6%, the staff has advised companies that they will require a minimum of 28.5% equity, with a commitment to reach 30% within a reasonable period of time, before approving a matter pursuant to delegated authority. There is some confusion about Sierra's prospects in this regard. The most recent amendment, filed June 14th, indicates that Sierra will be at 20.8% common equity at closing, with a representation that Sierra will increase its consolidated common equity to approximately 29 percent as a result of: (a) proceeds from the sale of generating assets of Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power aggregating approximately $1 billion, 100 percent of which will reduce debt of the consolidated company; (b) proceeds from divestiture of non-core assets, or some combination of common equity and divestiture of non-core assets, which together would be approximately equivalent to the issuance of $260 million in terms of impact on Sierra Pacific's equity ratio; (c) issuance of up to $600 million of hybrid securities; and (d) increased retained earnings realized from the combined operations of Sierra and PGE aggregating approximately $80 million in 2000 and $100 million in 2001. It is unclear how good these numbers are. They do not, for example, reflect Sierra's second quarter earnings release or the effect of a writeoff in connection with PGE's Trojan Plant. Bill Weeden will be meeting with Mark Ruelle Thursday to come up with \"firm\" numbers. In other matters, the SEC staff has indicated that it would give \"credit\" toward equity capitalization if the company has executed definitive agreements for sale of the subject assets, such as the Sierra water business and its generation assets. It is important to know when such sales may be announced so that we can factor them into our calculations. Assuming that Sierra can establish, based on these types of definitive agreements, that the merged company will be at 28.5% (once the underlying sales close) and Nevada has indicated that it will withdraw its intervention and Oregon has indicated that it will approve the merger, we would be in a position to meet with the SEC staff and ask for a year-end order based on our ability to settle with the California intervenors. Bill said he will call me Thursday after his meetings or Friday at the latest. Best, Joanne "

        "content": " skean.nsf Not much has happened with the federal filings since we submitted them (SEC application was filed on February 4, FERC application was filed on March 3). Ann has been keeping everyone updated on the DOJ review of the HSR filing. With regard to the FERC filing, FERC separated the section 203 merger application from the section 205 joint open access tariff filing. Interventions and protests to the joint transmission tariff (which will be used by the merged companies once the merger occurs), were due to be filed at the end of March. Interventions and protests to the section 203 application are due May 3. One party asked FERC to extend the deadline for interventions and protests on the tariff to be extended to May 3, and FERC granted that request. However, several parties filed interventions before FERC granted the extension, so some comments have been filed. The only significant substantive comment came from the Public Utility Commission of Nevada (PUCN). PUCN opposes the merging parties' license plate rate proposal and instead favors a rolled-in rate structure (where the rates of the three individual systems -- Nevada Power, Sierra Pacific, and Portland General) are averaged together so that transmission customers on any of the three systems would pay the same transmission rate, regardless of which system they use. We have some answers to this protest. First, one of FERC's main concerns with regard to transmission rates is the elimination of pancaked rates (paying multiple transmission rates for moving over multiple systems). The joint open access tariff eliminates pancaking and uses instead a license plate approach (pay the rate of the system where the power is being delivered and have transmission access over all three systems for that one rate). Second, if the rates are averaged together, rate payers in the low cost region will pay a higher transmission rate. Third, depending on the RTO configuration, PGE could be in a separate RTO from Sierra and Nevada, so different rates, at least for PGE, would be warranted. We plan on filing an answer to the PUCN protest at the same time we file an answer to the other protests and comments that will be filed on May 3. FERC does not typically allow answers to protests, so we did not want to submit multiple answers to the various pleadings. We expect the majority of protests to be filed in the section 203 merger application docket. Once we see the extent of the protests, we will have a better idea of whether FERC should be able to issue an order on the merger by the end of July (before they leave for August recess). The SEC proceeding has been quiet. There are four major mergers ahead of our application (AEP/CSW, Energy East, NSP/New Century, ComEd/PECO), so we do not expect the SEC to focus on our filing until they are closer to ruling on these other mergers. We will keep you posted on any significant events on the federal side. In the meantime, please call or email me if you have any questions. Sarah "

As you may be aware, the Sun Devil project parallels the Transwestern (TW) system to Flagstaff, AZ and will then turn south and parallel a El Paso lateral into Phoenix. KM has made a proposal to provide services to TW under a \"lease transaction\" for that portion of the pipeline from San Juan, NM to Flagstaff. The KM proposal offers two obvious advantages: i) It would allow TW to lower its capital cost to construct the total system, and ii) It would lower the fuel allocated to Sun Devil by TW. There also may be ways to further reduce the tariff proposed to Sun Devil by KM, if TW can provide some of the operations and administration services for KM. We have been negotiating with Shippers for a fee that would yield a minimum rate of return based upon our proposal to build and own the entire system. However, the KM proposal could allow us an opportunity to save on fuel, operating, administrative and capital costs, thus possibly achieving better project returns, if TW is able to capture revenues from these savings. We would like to explore assessing the Sun Devil Shippers an allocated fuel rate and other fees commensurate with TW's current rate structure. Will FERC regulations permit us to do these things? Should the Sun Devil Pipeline be part of TW or should it be under some other corporate structure to capture revenues? Does the lease transaction give TW an accounting or tax benefit? I have attached the KM proposal for your perusal. Please keep it confidential. Thank you for your help. Steve"

I can also agree to your language and a trigger of BELOW BBB- for the Additional Event of Default. Regarding the Set-Off issue, I attach language for your consideration which demonstrates our agreement to include a Non-Defaulting Party's Affiliates.

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry. Thank you.

        "content": " rshapiro.nsf Based on a series of meetings and discussions with many you, below is an outline of the proposed strategy for Com Ed. I will be meeting with Commissioner Harvill and also the Commissioners' assistants on Wednesday to deliver our message, so if you have any comments on this, please get back to me as soon as possible. (Com Ed is scheduled to meet with the Commissioners on Thursday). The Facts - Customers currently have three rates to choose from: the fixed price bundled rate, the PPO which is a discount off the Fixed price bundled rate, or an alternative rate provided by a marketer (ARES). Most of Enron's customers are on the PPO although some are on the bundled rate. Com Ed sent a letter to the ICC in which they propose to replace the PPO with a spot market price plus adder to be effective at the end of 2004. Com Ed also acknowledges that with rising market prices, some of the industrial customers are or soon will no longer be paying a CTC. With the relinquishment of the CTC obligation comes Com Ed's obligation to provide the PPO rate. In conversations, Com Ed indicated that they would like to replace the fixed bundled price with a performance based rate at the end of 2004. An internal analysis prepared by Mark Ulrich sets forth the negative impact of removing the PPO on our current book of business. Issues of Concern: * Protection of our current book of business * Ability to physically deliver into Com Ed on a competitive basis * Potential for Default Service deal * Potential to market individual customers on a one-on-one basis The Plan: Our public position will be that without the capability to physically deliver power into the Com Ed market on a competitive basis, the PPO rate should not be lifted since customers are left without reasonable options or protection. Our negotiated position in order of priority is as follows: 1. Protect our current book of business. We should negotiate a rate with Com Ed that leaves us whole. This could include the provision by Com Ed of ancilliary services. There is an FRP tariff rate that has expired but that we believe offered ancilliary services at a rate that allowed other marketers to physically deliver. We are in the process of obtaining the tariff to see if that would work for us to negotiate from, even though it has expired. In essence we want to negotiate a new PPO rate under which Com Ed continues to supply our existing customers or preferably that enables us to physically deliver to our customers at the same price as the PPO. Mark Ulrich and Guy Sharfman are going to develop a rate that we can take to Com Ed for our entire book of business. 2. Leverage new business opportunities for EES. These opportunites include acquisition of all or a portion of Com Ed's industrial default customers as well as individual customer accounts. (We believe that Com Ed wants to free itself from its obligation to serve industrial customers, so there may be an opportunity). The concept is to fold these new customer acquisitions into the same deal negotiated for our current customers, allowing EES to expand its customer base and potentially its physical delivery capabilities. From the standpoint of acquiring individual customers, we should advocate a real time price plus adder starting in 2003 for customers who roll off the CTC. 3. Push for Com Ed support of Enron's positions at the ARTO working level. Nothing in our agreements, however, with Com Ed should be contingent on the RTO functioning, such that Com Ed can have an out for its obligations to Enron under the deal. Janine. "

EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA, and to disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or assets. The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment creditors.

The strategy here is that if we obtain the oil and gas rights, then we believe we lock up the oil and gas leases covering the existing helium rights owned by another entity. We are using this as leverage to get a better deal from the helium rights owner. As listed in Article 7.7, the acquisition wouldn't close until final approval by members of Crescendo. We are prepared to risk (and its not really even at risk based on the termination provisions in Article 10) the $12,000 downpayment to work a deal with the helium rights owner. Let's discuss ASAP. Thanks, Ken - RMOC Purchase Sale Agrmnt PG&B.doc - RMOC Purchase.ExB PG&B.doc"

These are situations in which an EnronOnline trade has been completed, but we have agreed verbally with the other party that the trade will be deemed not have happened and we may have suppressed generation of a faxed confirmation. It is of great importance that we do not do anything which makes an EnronOnline trade appear as though it is not firm, or not reliable, or which affects the audit process. Therefore, EnronOnline transactions must not be killed. Individual traders might elect to conduct an OTC transaction which has the effect of reversing the impact of an EnronOnline transaction - this activity is outside the scope of EnronOnline. Please note that there has never been an instance in which there has been a system error on EnronOnline which caused a trade to take place which was not initiated by the customer. All instances to date have involved some kind of operator error, or failure to use the results of a Transaction Search to verify completed deals. Dave "

        "content": " SHARRIS1 (Non-Privileged).pst Thank you for your interest!!! Judgment Courses offers an extensive training course in \"How to Collect Money Judgments\" . ' s6 If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments can earn you very substantial income . If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a Money Judgment against them. You are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact: \"Its now up to you to collect on the Judgment\". The court does not require the loser to pay you. The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found. The result is that millions of Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten. \"In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a dime.\" The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions. Right now in the United States there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more Judgments take its place. We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed. With our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing Money Judgments. By following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of Money Judgments. The income potential is substantial in this profession. We have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices. Today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates. Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies, police officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us for reports. Many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars. Legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10% interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments. Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to $500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the payment of the principal. Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per year. This is just for interest, not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income. Typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars. 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43% are women and 36% are part time . One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are working on will be there when you return. The Judgments are still in force, they do not disappear. The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you are. You are not a collection agency. Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing are as follows: Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who to write to) 8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them unless you want to. You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and 50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for $2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00. You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you. They range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc. The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to 1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge $6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $25.00. Once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located. (Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course) When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to the original Judgment holder. Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of Judgment to the court. (Included in the course) Quote's from several of our students: Thomas in area code 516 writes us: \"I just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars . Your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on. After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in area code 314 stated to us: \" I am now making $2,000.00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in judgments I am collecting on now.\" After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated \" I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately $500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I will have to hire someone to help out\" Marshal in area code 407 states to us \"I feel bad, you only charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months\" From the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following: With our course you can own your own successful business. A business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to retire on and travel the world. A business which is extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every day is new and exciting. None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen for many others already. Make it happen for you! If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation on your part. Please call us at 1--4 0 6 --6 5 2 --0 1 9 4 .. We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to 9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week . If you call this number you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.

They liked the strategy of going with Entergy (although they were nervous about some of the people we might have to deal with) and looking at other alternatives. Initially our empahsis is to get them up and running without delay. Any other plan would not be prudent. They would like to have the LOI reference our plan to provide the ancilliary services. Not play attorney again but....can we add some language like the following: Ancilliary Services: EPMI would arrange for The cities to contract for ancilliary services with Entergy in accordance with the Entergy tariff for an interim period beginning May 1, 2001. During that interim period, EPMI would solicit ancilliary proposals from other control areas, as feasible. If an alternate to Entergy is identified, EPMI may recommend that The Cities contract with the alternate for the balance of the EPMI term. Christi has reservations about this maybe not having enough wiggle room for us, and I agree. There are a few other places in the LOI we will need to reference the ancilliary management responsibility EPMI is contemplating. Also, I think this creates a need to have a definition of ancilliary services in the LOI. We have a meeting scheduled with Entergy for Tuesday morning to discuss Enron buying ancilliary services. Further I have called several of the other control areas (CLECO, Alabama Electric Co-op, NRG, SMEPA, and LEPA) to assess their interest in providing ancilliaries and wait for return calls. Marvin promised to light a fire under David Hunt ASAP. You should already have heard from him. I will call you tommorrow. Thank you very much, Reagan 5.3363"

McCutchen is a 300+ lawyer firm with its main office in San Francisco and offices in Los Angles, Palo Alto and Walnut Creek. The firm has a very strong reputation in major commercial litigation (antitrust, securities fraud etc) and technical and IP litigation. I believe ENA has worked with McCutchen in the past on some power plant matters. Rob Walters has worked closely with Chris Hockett (who I have also met) and has a very high opinion of his abilities. I concur that Chris (a 40ish commercial litigator) is a very impressive individual. David Balbanian, more senior than Chris, is apparently widely known as one of the leading commercial litigators in Northern California.

        "content": "Securities Purchase Agreement (Highstar/ENA) This time with attachments... Attached are both clean and marked copies of the revised draft of the Securities Purchase Agreement, which incorporates the changes discussed in our meetings last week in NY. As to the revised draft, please note the following: 1) The revised draft does not consider any of the changes to the structure of the deal that will be required to solve the brokerage issues discussed earlier today among the lawyers. We are not sure at this point as to how these problems will be overcome, but will get back to you with our thoughts as soon as we can, and any assistance from the Buyer's perspective would be much appreciated. In the meantime, ENA has told us to try to keep moving forward to the extent we can on the SPA. 2) There are still a number of issues in the SPA which the parties have not yet resolved. Included in these open points are the following: a) ENA feels very strongly about the need for a cap on liabilities and that the proposed amount of the cap in this case is already one of the highest agreed to in recent transactions. b) Reps and warranties - after considerable discussion among various parties at ENA, we have left out a number of the \"Material Adverse Effects\" and \"Knowledge\" qualifiers that were proposed in our original draft, as discussed in NY. However, we have added back a few where it was the strong consensus at ENA that these were market terms accepted in prior similar transactions. The standard for applying materiality is still open - in some cases we left the Buyer's proposed \"could reasonably be expected\" language; in other places we went back to the \"is likely to have\" language because in prior transactions, buyers have accepted the much stronger \"would have\" standard, which we should probably have insisted on from the beginning. We have also limited the real estate and environmental reps as discussed because of the insurance that ENA has already purchased and paid for to protect the Buyer from these risks. The IP reps were deleted because of the lack of any material known IP related to the Facilities. c) We have limited the opinions to be delivered to certain regulatory opinions only and omitted the Buyer's opinion entirely because of the size of this deal and the feeling that further internal opinions from ENA did not provide the Buyer with any further assurances. Please call us with any questions or comments on the SPA or the above. We are also still waiting for your conceptual list of comments on the Asset Management Agreement.

        "content": "New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals. The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done. These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is \"significant potential for undue discrimination\" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative. Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny. FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the \"linchpin\" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates. During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was \"important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side,\" that \"all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines.\" Last week's proclamation should be considered \"a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend,\" he asserted. In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties \"are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk\" of such unequal treatment. FERC declared that a \"key factor\" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an \"appropriate material deviation\" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide \"adequate alternatives\" to other shippers. In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs. The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, \"we have reconsidered that holding\" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order. Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an \"adequate alternative,\" the commission observed. \"However, if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not include any such provision.\" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk, giving it \"an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,\" the commission pointed out. \"A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,\" FERC said, adding that \"such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.\" Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights \"is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated\" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language \"will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.\" Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become \"muddled.\" Through a \"tortured line of cases,\" FERC's definitions of allowable contracting practices were \"obscured,\" Breathitt said in welcoming the new \"common-sense\" approach. The \"tug of war\" that parties have engaged in over the past few years \"really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service\" are available to all shippers, she said."

Since last week, the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM. It is unlikely that the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM. $202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of overruns and schedule. This would require the Owner to maintain a contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM. After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the numbers I saw last week. Schedule: Neither my team nor I had seen the provisions of termination by Petrobras, as stated in the DASH, prior to last evening. The ability of Petrobras to terminate at April 30, 2002 if the project is not completed due to circumstances within Enron's controls, is an unlikely risk, but not totally impossible. Further, the project is subject to a June 30, 2002, termination by Petrobras if the project is not completed due to force majeure. This is considered more of an onerous risk. It's not clear to me whether the requirement to complete the pipeline and bring gas to the project would be considered under Enron's control, considering that Enron is a partial Owner in CEG, the gas distribution pipeline company. On the other hand, we have indicated that an October 31, 2001 start-up, is reasonable, based on a full NTP by January 1, and site access on February 1. If the schedule is constrained by the RAC recommendation to limit expenses to $15MM, the October 31, start-up could be at risk. Performance: The stated agreement with Petrobras for 365 megawatts (site condition) and an average net degraded heat rate of 9169 btu/kWH, appears correct, if it is LHV. O&M Guarantee: The DASH is not clear on what O&M availability guarantee Enron is prepared to sign with Petrobras. I would suggest that OEC insure it agrees with any availability guarantees prior to Enron signing the Petrobras agreement. Rick, sorry for this late feedback, but our system of coordination with the RAC needs improvement. In the days when I worked with EI, EECC would provide to EI a written due diligence report direct, after checking the proforma against the PPA. This was an Enron lesson-learned after years of experience. The recent reorganizations have diluted this procedure. I suggest I discuss with you how to improve our due diligence process.

        "content": " skean.nsf From: Cynthia Sandherr 01/11/2000 05:16 PM Rick: Per your request, please find the one page description of how the Washington D.C. office prioritizes both human and financial resources while fitting within the Enron budget process. I have attached our 1999 activities report which illustrates the process described below. Congress operates in a two year cycle while the Administration operates in a four or eight year cycle. Thus, it is necessary for our prioritization to focus on the long term. Within the context of the Congressional and Administration's Calendars, our office determines and communicates doable priorities based upon the environment in which we operate. In addition, we actively work behind the scenes and commit resources to affect and change this environment. On an annual basis, we communicate federal legislative and global opportunities which we believe affect our operations via briefings to Steve Kean, who along with our assistance, submits our proposed goals to the Enron Management Committee, Global CEO's , individual operating company heads and heads of key divisions. Many dialogues and briefings occur resulting in goal adjustments and additions. During this dialogue, we advise on possible new corporate strategies based upon political realities and communicate necessary resources required in order to achieve the legislative successes. Once this vetting process is complete (December-January timeframe), and the Management Committee prioritizes the federal Corporate goals, we submit our budget and assure this budget directly correlates to the necessary resources (both human and financial) detailed and allocated to meet these priorities. (Note: the budget process usually occurs in the August-October timeframe). On the financial side, we keep current as to the rates and the expertise available on the market, as well as, track potential conflicts of interest. It's our job to know our environment and to lay out strategy. On an annual basis, we adjust our resources which can include dropping some issues, reassigning personnel, hiring or letting go necessary outside counsel, etc. We remain mindful that in order to achieve legislative success, it is necessary to follow long-term planning so as to allow for us to build credibility, keep important political relationships viable and, ultimately, place us in the best possible political position to achieve success. Our budget does its best to recognize that the Congressional process can be unpredictable and that Congress reacts to fast occurring events and public reaction. It is rare when we have not foreseen some form of a potential issue; thus, we always operate within budget. An example of a contingency issue would be India setting off a nuclear device, a possibility we had accounted for yet could not possibly exactly predict nor could we predict the fall-out and precise Corporate impact. However,we were still able to budget for possible permutations for such an occurrence and make adjustments as needed in order to meet our goals and stay within our budget. Based upon the experience of the people in our office, we have been very successful in anticipating these type of occurrences. Our report details our 1999 results and projects Enron priorities for 2000 although neither the President's State of the Union address which outlines the Executive Branch's legislative agenda for 2000 nor the Republican Congressional response and 2000 Congressional legislative agenda has as of yet been delivered nor finalized.

        "content": "Turbines Galore Rob made some changes in the e-mail I sent last Friday. He put the info about the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in para. 2 and used more defined terms from the ADA. I think we can use the same A&A agreement to notify WestLB of our intent to assign the P.O. and give notice as to the closing date. However, the current form of A&A agreement has sig. blocks for only ENA and WestLB. Seems like you need a sig. for the assuming party! Particularly since that party is purporting to give notice to WestLB of its intent to pay the purchase price! Rose To effectuate the movement of turbines out of the WestLB LM6000 structures the following needs to take place: 1) ADA - Assignment of the Purchase Option. On at least 5 (five) days notice to WestLB, ENA will assign the Purchase Option for the subject equipment and ancillary agreement to the purchasing entity. This assignment (the \"Assignment\") must release the Lessor (WestLB) from all its obligations under the Turbine Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject equipment and ancillary agreements. This means that GE Packaged Power (a division of GE) and other vendors must release WestLB from its obligations with respect to the subject equipment and contracts. (Kay - Could this be done by an amendment to the scheduled equipment under the various agreements between WestLB and the various vendors? Rose - I believe so, along with entering into the new contracts reference in 3)) The assignment agreement to effect this is explained below and can be prepared by Kay, Rose or Rob. 2) ADA - Closing of the Purchase Option. WestLB requires at least 5 (five) days written notice of the exercise of the purchase option and this notice can be included in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement. The purchase price for the subject equipment and agreements will be the \"Termination Amount\" as defined in the ADA, as allocable to the subject equipment and contracts. This amount is equal to the sum of i) the aggregate outstanding amount of the Advances, plus ii) any Transaction Expenses then due and owing. plus iii) all accrued amounts due on any Lessor Yield or Facility Fee, plus iv) any amounts owed for any costs reasonably incurred by the Lessor with respect to the subject equipment and contracts. The particular amounts of the foregoing costs and fees allocable to the subject equipment and contracts should be determined in coordination with Lisa Bills and Humberto Cubillos. The Assignment and Assumption Agreement used to consummate the Purchase Option is attached as Exhibit G to the ADA and can be prepared by Kay, Rose or Rob. It needs to be executed by ENA, ENA's Designee as assignee and WestLB. A detailed list of the equipment and contracts being assigned must be prepared by the assignee and attached to the assignment. 3) Assignment under the Turbine Purchase Agreement. The Purchaser (WestLB) under the Turbine Purchase Agreement (the \"Turbine Contract\") may assign a portion of its rights and obligations under the Turbine Contract to an affiliate of ENA without the Seller's consent. Kay has structured the Turbine Contract to allow the assignee to enter into separate purchase agreements with GE Packaged Power for the equipment being assigned. The documents to transfer title of the equipment from WestLB (in the case of equipment that is already fabricated) and to replace ENA with another business unit on the purchase agreement should be prepared by the business unit attorneys involved in the transfer, based on a form of contract which is very similiar to the Master Purchase Agreement. (Rose - the assignee/new owner needs to step into the turbine contract even if title has passed to WestLB, as there are lots of rights (warranty, indemnity) the new owner needs to have. It seems to me that you would transfer title in the assignment, then step into the remainder of the other rights in the new contract - a/k/a facility agreement. Then you delete the assigned equipment from the Master Agreement.) The tax specialists from both ENA and the acquiring business units should be advised as to the planned date of title transfer. Same generally holds true for the ABB transformers, except that the assignment to an Enron SPV may require a form of security. "

        "content": " BROGERS (Non-Privileged).pst The invoices for December 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by 23:00 today, Friday, September 28, 2001. The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices. Transmission Customers will observe adjustments to their settlements to: (1) recover costs related to adjustments made outside of the billing process; (2) adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and (3) adjust the NYISO clearing account balance to zero for December 1999 settlements. With regard to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these adjustments could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant data fix. As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments is done outside of the billing process. The total adjustment of $581,563.37 was allocated across 13,147,961 MWh. Customers may validate their respective adjustments by computing their ratio shares of the $581,563.37 using 5,059,790 MWh as the denominator in their respective ratios of their December 1999 load. Customers will observe a difference in the denominators used in the ratio share allocation of this adjustment versus adjustment #3. This is due to the fact that the costs for adjustment #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment. Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly. In October 2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred. In order to allow any changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market. This results in an over-collection which is being returned to Customers through an adjustment to their monthly balances. This billing treatment for the December 1999 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market totaling $5,219,402.09 allocated across 13,191,237 MWh. Customers where allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for the month. December 1999 settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to address the delay in invoicing. Payments due to the NYISO for December 1999 settlement adjustments are due to be received in the NYISO clearing account on Monday, October 15, 2001. Payments due to market participants will be made on Friday, October 19, 2001. Please refer to the attachment below for banking instructions. Regards, Randy A. Bowers Manager - Customer Settlements (See attached file: December_1999_2nd_Settlement Adjustment_Invoice_Banking_Instructions.PDF) - December_1999_2nd_Settlement Adjustment_Invoice_Banking_Instructions.PDF "

As you pointed out, this raises a question as to whether we should have been running the plant during the month. Hopefully, this brief explanation will clarify the reasons we continued to run. As stated above, the gross margin was slightly negative; however, this includes the cost of oxygen. Most of the oxygen expense (approx. $300,000) is a fixed cost because of our take or pay agreement with Praxair. As a result, when we evaluate whether or not to run, we look only at variable costs (which do not include $300,000 of oxygen). If we ignore this take or pay oxygen cost, then the gross margin is approx. $200,000 positive. This is roughly equal to our variable O&M costs which means that were at \"break even\" for variable margin and expenses. Given the high possibility of freezing temperatures in February and an analysis that indicated that we could break even for all variable costs, the decision was made to run the plant to protect against freeze damage. A simple schedule is attached to illustrate the break even analysis. "

        "content": "Update on SRP Margin Call Importance: High Tim, As you know, SRP made a margin call to EPMI on Monday, by letter, seeking $5.5 million in margin under a \"one-off\" contract. Tracy and I sent a letter back on Tuesday, arguing that the contract does not permit SRP to call for additional margin unless ENE is downgraded to junk status. SRP responded to our letter this afternoon. Predictably, SRP disagrees with our view of the contract and demands its margin. SRP says that it will treat our failure to post $5.5 million by Monday, November 12, in either cash or an irrevocable letter of credit, as an event of default and will terminate the contract. If this happens, EPMI would have to make a payment of $5.5 million within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from SRP. As you know, Tracy and I strongly believe that the contract does not support SRP's right to call for margin at this time. However, the contract is not perfect (they drafted it, after all) and there is a sentence fragment that supports their position. I recommend that we treat the SRP-EPMI dispute regarding the margining criteria under this Agreement as a \"Dispute\" under Section 17. Disputes are first submitted to Authorized Representatives (each company designates an Authorized Representative) to resolve. If the Authorized Representatives cannot reach agreement within 30 days, then the dispute is forwarded to you and your equivalent at SRP (the \"Executives\"). The Executives have to meet within 30 days to resolve the issue. If the Executives cannot resolve the issue within 30 days, then both parties can choose arbitration, or either party can take the matter to court. In summary, best case, this option gets us up to 90 days before we have to arbitrate/litigate the issue. Otherwise, we better prepare to post collateral Monday. If you want to handle this matter by taking the \"Dispute\" route, I should send a letter out tomorrow to SRP giving notice that we wish to try to resolve this through the contract's \"Dispute\" provisions. Steve (I should also mention that Tracy has informed me that SRP plans to issue a margin call on our WSPP contracts (approximately $4.5 million) as soon as it calculates the amount due.) "

(3) The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of (a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the closing of PPL's financing. (4) ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19, 2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract). (5) The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days after funding the escrow account. (6) Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before May 3, 2001. If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001, then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands. PPL's obligation to fund the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing. Greg Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give an estimated date for financial closing. I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were causing heartburn. He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker. He asked today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point. He also requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions. When you get a chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for PPL's review. Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to negotiate the fee. Let me know if we can assist in this regard.

You asked for a preliminary opinion following our telephone conference this morning on Enron?s contractual remedies and exposures on the FGPC contract. I am afraid the matter is complex and there is no straightforward answer. First, we should start with the contract which I have now read. I am assuming the NDC date has passed, but not the conversion date. Article 4.3 is an acknowledgment by the seller that the buyer?s preference is for condensate because of favourable tax considerations. There is however an unfettered option given by Article 4.4. to Enron to deliver alternative liquid fuel in the form of gasoil or naphtha meeting the quality specifications. The quality specifications for liquid fuel are set out in Appendix A. Article 8.1 under the abbreviation T provides for a liquid fuel tax differential which is a price burden falling on Enron as part of the price formulation. However, ?in the event seller is unable to deliver condensate using reasonable commercial efforts, but supplies another type of liquid fuel instead, T shall be deemed to be zero for the first 600,000 barrels (in the aggregate) of such other types of liquid fuel delivered in a contract year.? Other relevant Articles are 10.2 (buyer?s right to secure alternative supplies), the whole of Article 10 (seller?s default), the whole of Article 13 (determination of quantity and quality), 12.4 (mitigation of losses), and 13.3(a) (?buyer shall be under no obligation to accept delivery of any quantity of liquid fuel which fails to meet the quality specifications ??). No doubt there are other relevant Articles, but the above seem the important ones to me. The facts have been summarised already in numerous e-mails and correspondence and I certainly will not repeat them, except to say that I think it is correct that: (1) It is simply not possible to buy condensate applying test method D3605 for condensate. For this reason, for example, your contract with Phillips Brothers for the ?PACIFIC VIRGO? did not include this test method. (2) SGS consider D3605 is wholly inappropriate for condensate and have said that modifying D3605 with ?ashing? is the preferred method to achieve higher reproduceability. Indeed, the previous two cargoes of condensate supplied to FGPC have been tested using ?ashing?. (3) The gasoil has been nominated for August to replace the contaminated Elang arguably because of the lack of lead time to find suitable cargo of condensate, but more probably because the trader in question understandably is concerned that a substitute condensate cargo may fail if the plain D3605 test method is used. (4) FGCP have said in a recent e-mail dated 27th July that ?FGCP will not hesitate to reject any cargo which fails to meet the guaranteed specification and which offers any possibility of invalidating any guarantees or warranties given by Siemens?. They are therefore not prepared to entertain any amendment to the contract. Following our telephone conference, and having read the contract, I saw problems for Enron and decided to share my thoughts with John Lockey of Essex Court Chambers. He is the barrister specialising in such problems, often used by me and the firm for second opinions, and obviously helpful on a case such as this. We debated the subject at length and came to the following tentative conclusions which I shall put in bullet form. He and I are available for discussion at 08.30 a.m. tomorrow at my office and I propose to call you at that time to hear your comments and to deal with any questions you may have on the following: 1. We think that it is not possible for Enron to argue with any realistic prospect of success that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sell condensate applying test method D3605 satisfies the test of using reasonable commercial efforts to justify zero tax for the first 600,000 barrels of other types of liquid fuel in any contract year. It seems to us that this provision is designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate cargoes due to force majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered into and is not designed to provide effectively a let-out because the contract simply cannot be complied with at all from its start. FGPC will simply argue with some prospect of success, that they entered into the contract and agreed its terms regarding pricing, etc. on the basis that Enron was able to supply condensate applying D3605. This squares with what they have said in their recent e-mail which I have quoted above. The same e-mail goes on to say: ?The allowance for 600,000 barrels was built into the LFPC to act as a ?safety valve? only to be used should circumstances demand it.? 2. If we are right about what we say above, this means that Enron are in the invidious position of having to source condensate (to avoid the tax), not knowing whether it is going to meet D3605. If SGS test using D3605 and fail the cargo, the contract supposedly gives FGPC an entitlement to reject. Their cover costs could include gasoil with its additional tax as a ?cost? since there is no available condensate for sale on the market applying D3605, assuming we are right about this assumption in (1) above. 3. It occurs to us that it may be possible to argue with some merit that Appendix B has to be construed to imply a term that D3605 only applies to condensate if it is truly applicable to that grade. You will note that Appendix B sets out a test method in one column and three grades gasoil, naphtha and condensate in other columns. If SGS are right that the test method is inappropriate, they should not be testing against D3605 for condensate. Putting it another way, the condensate could be on spec applying the appropriate ?ashing? method, and the test method set out in Appendix B will not necessarily determine this. As you say, it is hit and miss. Objectively, the intention of the parties must be to apply the appropriate test method, or not to apply a test method if it is not capable of determining the contractual specification. Applying this reasoning, it means that Enron are not in breach by supplying a cargo of condensate in circumstances where the D3605 test is simply not carried out because contractually it cannot apply. 4. As we say above, we think SGS should not be carrying out this test at all if it is entirely inappropriate. Indeed, SGS, who are jointly appointed, should be instructed by Enron not to carry out the test. There is some force for this in Article 13.1(a) which says that measurement of quantities and taking of samples for the purposes of determining the quality of liquid fuel in each shipment should be carried out ?in accordance with international standard practice at the time of the shipment in question?. It is not completely on point since the clause does not deal specifically with testing. In the event that SGS confirm it is inappropriate to carry out the test and they simply do not test, the buyer will be left without any test certificate that shows the cargo has failed to meet the quality specifications. Should subsequently the buyer test on his own under D3605 and it fails, whilst SGS independently apply the ?ashing? method and it passes, we believe the buyers will be in difficulties in maintaining a lawful rejection. 5. Before this angle is pursued, we think SGS should be contacted to confirm the test method is inappropriate. We also think it is important that you and we have sight of the exact wording of the test method to see whether on its face it is inappropriate for condensate. This would help to reinforce the contention that it is inapplicable to condensate in Appendix B. 6. Finally, I should like to have sight of the Appendix 1 ?Typical laboratory condensate analyses? that is attached to the fuel supply plan that you faxed yesterday. We look forward to speaking to you at 08.30 a.m. tomorrow. Regards, David Best.

        "content": " skean (Non-Privileged).pst Yesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session. Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs. This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO. The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is \"subject to extension\" if new design requirements are introduced. We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures. A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached. One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance. We too believe this is necessary. It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance. We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible. Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market. We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear. Background The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a \"business plan\" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created. Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission. The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly. Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues: market design and governance. Market Design At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO. This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years (\"Option 1-M\"of the Business Plan). This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below). The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years (\"Option 2-M\" of the Business Plan). PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 (\"Option 3-M\" of the Business Plan). We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003. Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable. As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining \"Best Practices.\" Although PJM also conducted a \"best practices\" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are \"best practices.\" The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) \"far outstrips\" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support. However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM. The Judge states that \"impatience, haste and greed\" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process \"at the expense of sound policy\" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to \"exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint.\" See Report, page 18. Governance The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance: interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process. The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option. Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach. The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures. PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO. PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs: 5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England. The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins). NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board. One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO. The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders. We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system. Post Mediation The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge. The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment. We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition. We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared. Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal. Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal. Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report. Sarah, Dan, Howard and Tom "

Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some has been effective. It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an agreement. This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which vendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which we treat different vendors. I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide and conquer approach. 2. The agreements need to be updated. I know that there are some reasons for using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR PROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could be worked out. It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is some duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc., all things that could be fixed rather easily. 3. I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover all kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting. 4. If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an arrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement but the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for anything that they might do on the PWD. I realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what it is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view it with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking a methodology that has served us.

        "content": "Marketing Arrangements MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii Content-Disposition: inline Elizabeth: Following up on our conversation last week, I have an associate pulling some of the relevant authority on the fiduciary duty/principal--agent issues we discussed in the context of some of the deals ECT is considering with respect to marketing the output of generation units of third party owners. We should be able to get back to you this week with our thoughts in that respect and we will forward to you the major authorities, articles, etc. that we come up with. My sense of the market is that it is likely that ECT may be approached by many owners of power plants as the markets further deregulate and some of the owners of \"hard assets\" realize that they do not have the resources necessary to participate in the wholesale power markets. And, with the further market participant fall-out to come (witness PacifiCorp's retrenchment announcement on Friday), ECT could end up with a larger share of this market perhaps resulting in multiple deals with third parties, even parties whose facilities may be viewed in competition with one another (based on load pockets, grid interconnection, etc.). I agree with you that these deals carry a lot of legal risk because of ECT's commanding presence in these markets. In addition, I found the PECO marketing contract with Great Bay Power (\"GBP\") that, as you know, resulted in litigation earlier this year. I faxed it to you this morning along with a copy of the complaint that GBP filed against PECO earlier this year. Set forth below are a few of the key aspects of the PECO/GBP Contract that I thought you might find of interest, including some of the contract language that bears on the fiduciary duty/ principal-agent considerations. I thought it made sense to focus on some of these, not because it is a great contract, but I think it illustrates many of the concepts that your commercial people may wish to employ in the proposed marketing deals they are currently examining. Further, you will see how many of the key provisions dealing with the key legal concepts are either unclear or confusing or never really addressed. 1. Term; Exclusive Agent Relationship. The Contract was for an initial term of 2 years. PECO is designated to act as GBP's exclusive agent in marketing the power from GBP's only asset; namely, its interest in the Seabrook nuclear plant. Except as noted in Paragraph 2 below, GBP could not sell to customers without PECO's consent. GBP apparently sought the PECO deal since it needed a party to \"firm up\" its sales; that is, it needed a party to back up its Seabrook power in the event Seabrook went down. GBP retained title to all power until title passed to third parties. Of further note is that in connection with the contract PECO also received a warrant to purchase up to 4.9% of the stock of GBP. (This is similar to what ECT proposed with El Paso a year or so ago, but ECT proposed a warrant to purchase a greater percentage of the stock of El Paso.) Note that the 4.9% limit is '35 Act driven. More than 4.9% would be a \"second bite\" under the '35 Act that would require prior SEC approval and, in addition, could be problematic for PECO under the limitations of such Act. 2. PECO's Authority to Effect Deals for GBP. PECO could effect transactions for GBP, although it could not execute deals of more than a year in duration without GBP's consent. PECO also had the right to negotiate \"on behalf of\" GBP enabling agreements (such as those necessary to effect NEPOOL transactions), although those agreements would only become effective upon GBP's consent (which could not be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, GBP could cause PECO to offer a sale of power on terms directed by GBP if the sale was for longer than six months, provided GBP could not require PECO to firm up such sale. If PECO felt this was not the best course of action, it could terminate the Contract. 3. PECO Standard of Care. Sec. 4(a) of the Contract provides that \"PECO shall use 'reasonable best efforts' to arrange for the sale of the [GBP Power]\" and that it \"shall use the same care and diligence in arranging Transactions [involving the GBP power] as it uses in the sale of capacity and/or energy owned by PECO.\" PECO was authorized and required to use \"reasonable judgment\" during the negotiation and scheduling of transactions under the Contract. 4. Conflicting Sales Opportunities. Sec. 4(c) denominated \"Bundling of Initial Power Amount\" is of particular interest. Effectively, this provision requires that if some of the GBP power is available but not committed and PECO has other NEPOOL power available to it that can be used to effect a sale, then PECO shall be obligated to serve each such sale with both the GBP power and its own NEPOOL resources \"until the [GBP power] is fully utilized.\" It is not exactly clear how this provision is intended to work, but I would assume that if PECO located a candidate for a sale transaction and PECO could use its own NEPOOL power (defined as \"Other NEPOOL Supply\") to serve it or, alternatively, it could use the GBP power, then PECO would have to make the sale using both sources of power. It is not clear whether PECO would have to apply the GBP first or whether a pro rata concept (perhaps based on the ratio of the GBP power to the total power available) would be permissible. Obviously, this type of a provision would have major implications for the considerations we have been discussing since ECT would not want to be required either to use its counterparty's power first to make a sale or to apply some form of pro rata concept (which would be incredibly difficult to apply and a ticket to litigation). 5. Notice of Conflicting Opportunities. Sec. 4(d) of the Contract, denominated \"Economic Disincentive,\" similarly is interesting (and confusing). It provides, in effect, that if a portion of the GBP power is uncommitted but PECO owns Other NEPOOL Supply and PECO would make more of a margin by selling the Other NEPOOL Supply for its own account than effecting a deal for the GBP power, then \"PECO shall notify GBP of such circumstances.\" What is interesting is that it just requires PECO to notify GBP; it does not appear that there is any restriction on PECO's right to sell such power, except perhaps the restriction set forth in Sec. 4(c) above. Perhaps the negotiators of the Contract know how these provisions tie together, but it is not clear from the Contract itself. This is very surprising since one would think that it would have been in both parties' interests to make it absolutely clear how the fiduciary duty/corporate opportunity responsibilities were to be handled. 6. Compensation. With respect to compensation, PECO paid GBP a \"reservation fee\" in consideration of GBP retaining PECO as its exclusive agent, which was based on a $ per MWh basis. GBP paid a \"service fee\" to PECO based on a % of net sales revenues. (It really wasn't on a net basis, however, since it effectively was based on gross revenues less transmission and ancillary services costs). 7. Commitments for Future Opportunities. Another interesting feature of the Contract was the parties' commitments to engage in \"future joint opportunities.\" For example, Sec. 13(a) states that \"PECO shall be obligated to provide Great Bay with the opportunity to participate in all purchases of [additional favorably priced power from facilities in New England having a term in excess of 1 year].\" (Emphasis added). As with many other provisions of the Contract, it is not clear what happens if PECO and GBP do not agree on the sharing of costs, revenues, etc. with respect to such additional opportunities. 8. Early Termination Rights. In addition to termination for a breach of the Contract, GBP could terminate upon 30 days notice prior to certain dates (tied to the warrant expiration date). PECO, as noted at paragraph 2 above, could terminate on 90 days notice if GBP elected to effect a sale on its won (that essentially PECO felt would not maximize the parties' profits). 9. Choice of Law. PECO was able to get Pennsylvania law to be the governing law. Presumably, this was a function of the fact that GBP had less negotiating leverage and \"needed\" PECO to help it with firming up its sales. 10. The Litigation. In its complaint, GBP alleged, among other things, that since inception of the Contract PECO only effected two firm energy transactions for GBP. In addition, it asserted that PECO entered into a number of wholesale transactions for its own benefit, rather than in the name of GBP. I apologize for the length of this E-mail, but in light of the importance of these issues to the deals ECT is considering, I thought it made sense to give a flavor of the PECO/GBP contract. We will be back to you later this week with the outcome of our research. Please call me if you have any questions or need anything else. John"

Immediately following the memorandum is the ECA itself. It now carries the number ECA20001208A. The memorandum and the ECA are also being posted on the OASIS. MEMO Date: December 8, 2000 From: William J. Museler, President & Chief Executive Officer To: Steven J. Balser, Manager of Market Monitoring and Performance James H. Savitt, Market Monitor Re: Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw: HAM Transactions Failing Checkout (ECA 20001208A; re-issuance of ECA 20000907A) Thank you for the presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance Unit and the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with the Market Participants in addressing the market design flaw concerning import and export transactions, including wheel-through transactions, that fail the check-out procedure between the completion of BME and the SCD operating hour. I am pleased that the Business Issues Committee gave unanimous support to the NYISO to re-issue ECA 20000907A until the Market Participants can consider and approve, and the NYISO can implement, a tariff change required to permanently address the Market Design Flaw. As stated in my Memorandum to you of September 6, 2000, I agreed with your conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a ?Market Design Flaw? as defined in Attachment Q to the ISO OATT, Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?). As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed with your analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw would, absent appropriate action, remain at levels different from what would otherwise occur during periods of efficient competition. I have now determined, based on consultations with ISO Staff and the support of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain in effect the corrective measures adopted as ECA 20000907A while consultation and cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is on-going to develop and implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance with the ISO Agreement. Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and post it on the OASIS, for implementation effective at the expiration of ECA 20000907A. The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days. William J. Museler, President and CEO New York Independent System Operator cc: Market Participants via OASIS New York Independent System Operator Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208A: Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout Applicability This Extraordinary Correction Action (ECA) shall apply to: ? Import and export transactions; ? that are scheduled for an operating hour in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM) by the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME); and ? that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market Participant, or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant. Wheel-through transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export transaction, and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of both financial impacts, as provided below. This ECA shall not apply to import, export, or wheel-through transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or action, or neighboring control area operator error or action. Rationale Import Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME reduces commitments for energy resources within NYCA to accept scheduled import transactions at a specific proxy bus indicated by the Market Participant. Where the scheduled import transaction fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price at the proxy bus may be elevated above the HAM price due to the failed import transaction. The difference between the real-time price and the BME price at that proxy bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the real-time market. Under this ECA, this amount (when positive), multiplied by the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour, shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction. Export Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME makes commitments for energy resources to supply scheduled export transactions up to the purchase price indicated by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus. Where the scheduled export transaction fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price at the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to the failed export transaction. The difference between the BME price and the real-time price at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part of Schedule 1 costs. Under this ECA, this amount (when positive), multiplied by the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour, shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction. Wheel-Through Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME includes scheduled wheel-through transactions up to the transmission congestion cost that equals the decremental bid indicated by the Market Participant. Where the scheduled wheel-through transaction fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price at both the import and export proxy busses may be elevated or depressed, respectively, due to the effects on transmission congestion of the failed wheel-through transaction. Under this ECA, the effects of the import and export portions of the failed wheel-through transaction will be calculated separately, as though they were separate failed transactions. The sum of those impacts shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed wheel-through transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction. Implementation Rules 1. An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy is delivered to the NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the scheduling entity?s BME Bid Price, and buying the energy that was not delivered from the LBMP Market at the Real-Time LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy Generator Bus. No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not delivered due to an error or action by the NYISO or the delivering Control Area. No payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is lower than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to deliver scheduled energy. 2. An External Transaction for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy is received from NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity buying the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling entity?s BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP Market at the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus. No payment will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the receiving Control Area. No payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is higher than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to take scheduled energy. 3. An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at one external Proxy Generator Bus and the delivery of energy from the NYCA at a different external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy is delivered to or received from the NYCA in real-time, will be settled by applying rules 1 and 2 of this ECA separately to the failed delivery of energy to the import Proxy Generator Bus and the failed receipt of energy at the export Proxy Generator Bus, and summing the total of the two amounts for payment by the scheduling entity. No payment will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the delivering or receiving Control Area. No payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant for the import or the export portion of the External Transaction if no payment would have been required had that portion of the transaction been a separate transaction under rule 1 or 2 of this ECA.

In the interim, an approval process will be implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and correct general ledger coding. Effective Monday, November 20 the following approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater: (A) Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two approvals: a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting Director approval of the general ledger coding. (B) Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an Accounting Director approval of the payment and general ledger coding. In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached. If not attached, then the payment will not be processed.

Enron's shareholder representative was also involved. The parties reached agreement in principle on the open issues (the owner dropped its claims against EECC, EECC relinquished two smaller claims, the Owner will pay EECC's remaining claims). Bracewell's analysis of the claims was very helpful in reaching this result. Marmara: As expected, Black&Veatch has filed a formal notice of arbitration against EECC relative to sums they claim are due them with respect to the Marmara Project. EECC management expects that this will be settled early next year, and that it may provide an opportunity to reach a global settlement with Black & Veatch re Puerto Rico and potential future work. Gail Brownfeld and Scott Burdine of Hagans, Bob, Burdine are both up to speed. Dabhol: Besix has informed us that we will be receiving thier notice of arbitration re the Dabhol Quarry before the end of the year. We are told that they have changed their counsel, apparently releasing the English firm of Masons and engaging a firm in Washington DC of Watts, Tieder, Hoffer & Fitzgerald to carry the claim forward. This is an unusual move, since the contract is governed by English law and the site of the arbitration will London. Besix's local representative told our project manager that Besix was not happy with the Masons advice, but it may be that they want a US firm involved, backed up by an English firm. I have asked Phil Bruns to check into the reputation of Watts, Teider. He was not familiar with them, but has found that it is a 67 lawyer firm that specializes in construction and real with a main office in northern Virginia and offices in California. Gail Brownfeld, Phil Bruns, and Jonathon Rosshandler are all aware of this development. JWVS "

This is the kind of work environment we all must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us comments about the things that are important to you.

We now have a way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality. In the future, when we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the question and our response will be posted on eMeet. This will allow us to answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is an open discussion board.

I think a simple checklist for the marketers, legal & reg. would help. Here's what I suggest: - Marketer: Work with Susan on negotiated rate contract language. E-mail draft of contract to Glen, Mary, Susan, Mary Kay and Drew for information and for sign-off by Legal and Regulatory prior to sending to the shipper. - Mary and Susan -- have a telephone conversation to confirm that a filing needs to be made, and if so when. If a filing does not need to be made immediately, note filing date on both Mary's and Susan's calendars (and on Filing Log). - Marketer: Contract must be executed at least one day before gas flow. Once contract is executed, immediately (1) fax it to Mary at 402-398-7006 and (2) make sure the contract representative (Linda Trevino?) knows that it is a negotiated rate deal and needs to be posted on the transactional report. - Mary? Susan?: Contact Linda Trevino to let her know the negotiated rate tariff page that should be reference on the transactional report. - Mary/Glen: Draft negotiated rate filing and have Susan or Maria review. Rate language in tariff should be identical to contract negotiated rate language. Send to D.C. for filing. Let me know if I've left anything out, and I'll get this edited, spiffed up, etc. and circulate it to the marketers so we can get through April and all other future deals without a hitch. "

Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the transformer as well as the turbine? 2. Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the equipment, not just the sale. I believe this should be a TEH responsibility. 3. Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a reference is fine). 4. Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement? If fact, please review the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss same. 5. Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here. We should specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed by a credit worthy entity. 6. Timing of delivery of contract and funding - in discussing this matter with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing. 7. Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the nitty gritty of our financing structure. I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of where we are headed. Thanks, Kay"

Only 40 hours of \"automatic\" carryover will be allowed. Any additional vacation carryover must be approved. Employees will be able to go into vacation arrears up to their maximum entitlement for the year, plus any carryover.

We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR). After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation. Rick Miles will be the mediator. The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims. Both parties indicated a willingness to settle. Rick Miles will act as a facilitator. Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative. As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve. Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case. Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits. Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting. A neutral location needs to be agreed upon. Once additional information is learned, I will advise. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me."

Although I find this disappointing, we obviously need to address this development. We think the proper approach is to retain the firm recallable release structure we developed. That creates a present release into Enron's hands of the contracts, which was Barry's stated desire. We would retain a recall right BUT we could only exercise it in accordance with the Support Agreement (e.g., monthly, so long as not in default). We understand that you might want some further assurance that we would not misuse that right. To that end, I have resuscitated the Collateral Trust and Security Agreement. In other words, we would give you a first priority lien on the applicable transportation packages so that if we improperly recalled the capacity (which we of course would not), you would still be the senior secured party on the capacity and be entitled to exercise your remedies of foreclosure. Moreover, as Lisa and I discussed when we first considered the security interest, this security interest would be exempted from the automatic stay in accordance with Section 362(b)(17) of the Bankruptcy Code and thus you would be in a position to exercise your lien notwithstanding even the meltdown scenario of a bankruptcy.

The motions were directed primarily to Arthur Andersen and, to a lesser degree, to Enron. None of your names were mentioned at the hearing. Arthur Andersen and one of the plaintiffs' lawyers had agreed on a proposed order for preserving documents. Other plaintiffs' lawyers said that the agreed order was not stringent enough. With respect to Enron, there is some doubt as to whether the court can enter any order regarding Enron, because that may be the exclusive purview of the bankruptcy court. Although the issue of which attorney should be appointed lead counsel was not technically before the court, most of the hearing was consumed with the various plaintiffs' lawyers arguing that the court should select them to be lead counsel. The court said that it would not rule on the motion regarding preservation of documents until after 3:00 tomorrow. All of the plaintiffs' lawyers are to get together in the next 24 hours to see if they can agree amongst themselves as to what they want the court to do.

From: Rita Wynne @ ECT 03/29/2001 11:05 AM To:Bob M Hall/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject:New Profit Centers Bob, Per our conversation - on this past Tuesday, a group met from VM, Gas Acctg. and East Risk to discuss the recording of the 12 east desks and 7 central desks to SAP. Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East will record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas were done in Feb.'s g/l). According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA for each of the profit centers (19 in total). As we discussed, VM does not have the appropriate Unify reports or manpower to support this level of accounting at this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we have in the past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their side of the UA4 calc. to match us. With the foresight of eventually going to profit center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be significant changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle thislower level of reporting. I believe the flash is already being done at the different profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still performing their analysis at a more consolidated level. There were discussions inthe meeting that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opinion that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the organization - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process will need to be able to handle this level of detail. Of course, no decisions were made in our meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will remain unchanged for this month. Please let me know if you want to discuss further. Thanks! "

Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world. Mars is not in the habit of disclosing its finances, so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%. Mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R)) food (Uncle Ben rice (R)) pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other products. Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company. Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win solutions with its suppliers, customers and partners. As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand (people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer). CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting weather and has been very successful, with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas. CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas. It is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer. Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in this area. Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to. In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to anything at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future.

        "content": " sbrawne.nsf Introducing your first SAP Paycheck! This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of Corporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below. What's Different? ? Your =01+home' cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay advice. This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial modules of SAP. ? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P' represent earning types reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time for the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice as =01+PVacation'. ? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions will remain itemized in the deduction section. ? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-date totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your pay advice throughout the year. (Note that your W2 at the end of the year will reflect your earnings by company). ? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the related dollar amount will be included in the =01+Salary' earnings type. ? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555 Payroll FAQ's My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stand for? There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck. For some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to print. In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions and prints them on one line =01) titled =01&other deductions=018. The detail of all deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet at eHRonline.enron.com. What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean? These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll from the side index. Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck? Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected in the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice as =01+POvertime'. What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)? For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit is applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amount withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FICA will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return. What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock options? There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form requesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , select Enron Payroll from the side index)."

To that end, Martha believes that the proceedings should be heard sometime in January 2002, depending upon which of the cases is consolidated into the other. Martha believes that consolidation is appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are consistent and that, for evaluation purposes, the DEP considered the sites as one. Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted our position on the proposed consolidation. I told her that we would likely oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing our position. Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages. The cases, if consolidated, may be less expensive to try. Yet, the hearing in December may be at risk if consolidation occurs. In addition, the parties are not exactly the same in each proceeding (Margate is not a participant in the Deerfield proceeding). I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible with Enron's position on the proposed consolidation. If she does not hear back from me soon, then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate that Enron objects to the consolidation.

The two companies are leaders in the industry, with IP heading this year's PPI Top 150 survey and Stora Enso coming in fourth. While not completely writing off the possibility of a deal, the sheer size of the companies led a number of analysts to question whether competition authorities would green-light a merger. If any deal was to go ahead, most analysts agreed that some divestments would be necessary. Hannu Nyman of Conventum and H?kon Lerstad of ABG Sundal Collier both felt a union would create competition problems. Nyman said there would be too much market dominance in some sectors in the US. Lerstad agreed, saying that if the pair joined forces, they would enjoy a market share of approximately 40% in the US coated paper market. But UBS Warburg analyst Denis Christie thought the companies might be able to get away with this, pointing out that Abitibi-Consolidated has a similar market share in the US newsprint sector. One analyst, who preferred not to be named, said that if there was any truth to the rumors, it was more likely to be on a smaller scale, with the companies perhaps talking about a few assets rather than a full-blown merger. Nyman does expect to see further consolidation in the paper industry, but on a smaller scale. \"I am more inclined to believe that the big players...will continue to grow by buying small and medium-sized companies and expanding their coverage by area that way.\" Stora Enso recently gained a firm foothold in the North American market through its acquisition of Consolidated Papers. When that merger was announced, the company suffered a shareholder backlash, with its share price dropping 15%. Although doubting the likelihood of a union with IP, Nyman said that if a merger did take place, Stora Enso shareholders would benefit due to IP's stronger performing shares. \"It would probably result in a 50% improvement on Stora Enso's current share price,\" he added. A company spokesman said Stora Enso has a policy of not commenting on market rumors. The firm would neither confirm nor deny the speculation. But if a merger was to go ahead, the new entity would have combined sales of around $32 billion and a paper and board output of some 27 million tonnes/yr, based on PPI's Top 150 survey for 2001. "

But with so many new options, it doesn't have to be this way. --VIABLE ALTERNATIVES ABOUND True though it may be that your West or Lexis rep is out to put you on that fat annual contract, both companies offer a variety of online alternatives. A person can: ----log in and buy most any document for a few bucks ----Shepardize or Keycite for around $4 ----subscribe to KeyCite for $35 a month ----rent a state for a week for $40 ----conduct transaction based case law searches only when you have to ----Supreme Court case law from 1790 is now available on the web for FREE ----California state case law from 1934 is now available on the web for FREE ----the landscape continues to change rapidly --CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB There can be no question that the commercial value of proprietary legal research resources will continue to drop as more and more primary and secondary materials migrate online. At TheLaw.net Corporation we advocate choosing the right tool for the job. And one of the best single tools you can own these days is our flagship software solution, TheLaw.net Professional Legal Browser. --LESS THAN $1 A DAY FOR EVERYTHING, UNLIMITED ACCESS For just $395 annually for an individual, TheLaw.net gives you a remarkable foundation of primary and secondary resources, on an unlimited use basis, with a national scope, including, but certainly not limited to, the following: ----A great proprietary, searchable case law database that includes the U.S. Supreme Court, the 13 Federal circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and intermediate appellate courts. See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm ----Literally millions of searchable cases, updated four times daily, offered on an unlimited use basis ----Streamlined access to: ------Federal and state statutes, rules and regulations ------the CFR and Federal Register ------executive agency databases and bill trackers ------nearly 1,000 news resources ------another 1,000 reference desk tools ------nearly 10,000 practice area helpers and much, much more ------over 50,000 documents and databases ------all just a fast click or two away on your desktop 24 - 7 - 365 --THELAW.NET MAY OR MAY NOT BE ALL YOU NEED Depending on size, practice area and/or jurisdiction, TheLaw.net may well have everything you need. If not, West and Lexis are available online, a la carte for those times when you really need them. As an example, TheLaw.net is not yet a great resource for Federal District Court opinions. It all depends on what you want your life to look like. If the convenience and elegance of the gold standard is worth the rates charged by the legal research cartel, you should keep doing what you've been doing and renew that annual contract with Company A or Company B.

For the regular deals: Primary Contract Admin person is Michelle Cormier, backup by Dennis Lee. Michelle Lokay will essentially take over the admin duties previously handled by Christine Stokes including generating discount letters and inputting rates in the system. Backup will be handled by TK Lohman, Kevin Hyatt, and Craig Buehler. The contract log and previous \"firm book report\" will be replaced by the automated \"Transactional Report\" from the contract system. We will also look at establishing a \"general\" mailbox to which customers can send contract change requests. This way multiple team members can access the box and handle the requests. For On-line Deals Michelle Lokay is the primary contact working with Michelle Cormier. Counter-parties will not receive a paper contract but will be get a confirming email. Credit will be have already been approved as part of the online process. Michelle Lokay will print the screen once a deal has been lifted and route that to Contract Admin for input to the system. M.

        "content": " eric linder 6-28-02.nsf This Information Applies ONLY to Organizations Supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable Processing Centers Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement and payment tool, iBuyit eProcurement, is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central. But there is still more to come! On May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers. The new iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of receipt and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issue resolution. In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the way you currently order and pay for goods and services. Following these changes will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit Payables system. Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when placing an order and instruct them to reference this information: * Company Number or Legal Entity Name * Contact Name * Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order Number * New P.O. Box (See Below) What is an EID? An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back to the purchaser electronically through iBuyit. Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders? Yes. When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID. It is your responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for non-purchase orders. Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders? No. When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do. What if I do not know my EID? All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number. You can access your EID number in eHRonline. Logon to eHRonline, choose =01&Personal Information=018 to pull up your personal profile. On the leftside of the =01&Personal Information=018 screen select =01&Other=018 and you will see your: * PID (SAP ID) * GIS ID * EID What is our new mailing address (PO Box)? Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the following address: PO Box 4734 Houston, TX 77210-4734 What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me? HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope =01&Attention Enron Accounts Payable,=018 and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enronmail center. FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable department in Houston. Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following physical address: 3724 Dacoma Houston, TX 77092 ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE Note: ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order invoices locally. How will vendors learn about these changes? This information will be shared directly with vendors in a separate communication. Questions? Send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>"

I remember when we started this last July (remember the $1 DASH ?!), the hurdles that kept popping up (oh, just a little bankruptcy proceeding), and the s-l-i-c-k structuring of the entire transaction. Bought if for $3.5 million, sold it for $26 million, marked an incremental $5 million on a coal contract, and still have the right to \"broker\" another sale and keep 90% of the proceeds ( another $10+ million)!!

As indicated earlier, I do have one more provision for your consideration which our attorney recommends we include in all of Cargill-Alliant's Schedules.

It is consistent with language we have commonly seen used for similar entities. I would suggest we include it in the Schedule as a new Part 1(g). The provision reads as follows: \"(g) The 'Bankruptcy' provisions of Section 5(a)(vii) are hereby amended by: (i) adding in Clause (1) thereof (third line) after the word 'merger' and before the closed parenthetical the words 'or, in the case of Party B, any reconstitution, incorporation or admission or withdrawal of a member'; and (ii) adding in Clause (5) thereof (fourteenth line) after the word 'merger' and before the closed parenthetical the words 'or, in the case of Party B, any reconstitution, incorporation or admission or withdrawal of a member'.\" This would be the final item outstanding in the Schedule.

The approach we've taken to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic inventory of each ENA department's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a vice president or director) within each group to first explain this project and seek permission to perform the inventory, and then to ask that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff. There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan project. Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic records--much of it has never been captured. Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be maintained. During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area(s) use. The inventory itself is non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.

The attachment is in Power Point. Because the Application will be filed via Edgar, it will be publicly available and thus the reason for alerting Mark Palmer and Mark Koenig. Joe Sutton approved the filing yesterday, and I am waiting to hear back from Jim Derrick that Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling have approved making the filing. As soon as I get a \"green light,\" I will make the filing. Mark Metts and Mitch Taylor will use the Overview to orally brief Sierra Pacific. The important point for Sierra Pacific is that the Application is being made by Enron for legitimate business purposes unrelated to the PGE sale, and will not affect the PGE application. In this regard, we have expressly indicated in the Application that the PGE application should take priority and not delay the PGE transaction, and we will visit with SEC Staff to confirm this treatment. In any event, the SEC would request us to identify which application should take priority, and given the fact that the Application would become moot following a sale of PGE (and at which time we would withdraw the Application), the SEC should concur. Please call me if you have any questions. I also previously prepared a longer presentation for other members of our management and can provide this to you if you need further information.

To start the ball rolling, I have attached a form of the ESA marked to reflect my proposed changes. As I completed this late last week and then was called out of town, I have not had the opportunity to fully review it; however, it will give you the direction I am heading. I also spoke to Susan about other legal issues. They are the following: 1. GTC's - I am still not sure how the EOL GTC's can become part of CL unless they are there only for information sake and able to be printed. If we use the EOL GTC's, we will have to modify them to be applicable to CL, a process that can be accomplished. However, then we have GTC's for CL that I am not sure are useful. Since all customers have to have agreed to an ESA, there is really no place for CL GTC's (e.g., there will be no phone or non-electronic use of CL). 2. Confirm Central - I am still not sure how we need to handle the additional terms and conditions that are necessary for certain products. If the GTC's concept is viable, this is where this language should be placed; however, if the GTC's concept does not work, we have to develop another method of presenting them. We could leave them in the Annex and merely indicate that anyone dealing with products in the classes for which additional terms are attached to the Annex would be subject to those terms by accepting the Annex; however, this would make the Annex quite long. We could also have them pop up within the site once the customer clicks on the type of product (e.g., west power) to indicate that any action in this product is subject to these specific terms (this would require that we also have them in our site documents so that they can be printed). Once I have reviewed the updated FRS's for each of the sites, I will work to modify the Annex documents. Please let me know if you should need anything else at this time.

I would like to cover a few housekeeper issues and to plan for our next meeting and the EnronOnLine (EOL) demonstation. Non-Disclosure Agreement The demonstration will show you how the Market Manager programs work, the different behind-the-scenes administrative and data modules, and the screens a trader would use to load and trade on the system. In order to show these proprietary functions and screens, my management is requiring third parties to sign a confidentiality agreement. I have attached this agreement. Please have your legal team review it and direct questions to Tana Jones, paralegal, at 713-853-3399 or Mark Greenberg, legal counsel, at 713-345-8897. Suggested Day and Time for the Meeting & Demonstration How is November 1st or 2nd ? What days are good for you and your team? Format of the Demonstration We can provide various ways to demonstrate EOL and its applications. The simpliest way may be for HETCO to provide us with one or two desktops or laptops in order to view a remote, internet, demonstration from Houston, which would also feature an open phone line to my demo-team in Houston. In this way, HETCO and Enron get a live demonstration of the EOL system, but avoid the IT headaches of opening up the necessary internet port and setting aside the required IP addresses, which are necessary if Enron were to bring its own laptops and projectors. I can work with someone from your IT department to work out these details. Thanks again for this opportunity. Please reply or call me with any questions. I look forward to our next meeting. <<NDA_HETCO.doc>> * John Allario 713-853-4587 ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

        "content": " skean (Non-Privileged).pst In the past few months, Enron has received numerous requests from other companies to share some of the processes and systems that we have developed within HR. Also, several new businesses have been created recently by consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a huge untapped market in aggregating HR services. Recently, we completed an internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and have decided to explore some very specific external opportunities. Due to the time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning dedicated resources to this effort. Effective immediately, the HR community will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order to optimize HR transformation and commercialization. Taking the lead roles will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart). ? I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities. Reporting to me on this commercialization effort will be: Brad Coleman with the overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as PEP, Expertfinder and Global Compensation; Sarah Davis who will focus on Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barrow who will focus on Benefits and Wellness; and Yevgeny Frolov and Dan Brown who will focus on E-learning and Talent Management. I will continue to report to Steve Kean. ? David Oxley will take the overall lead for HR across all business units focusing on continuing to increase the value HR brings internally to Enron. The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Business Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report jointly to their business unit OTC's and to David from a functional HR perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean. ? Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation responsibilities. Kathy Schultea, Felecia Acevedo, Cindy Ward and Suzanne Brown will report into Mary's organization. Mary will continue to report to Steve Kean. ? With Drew Lynch's promotion to COO Metals and David's increased responsibilities, Robert Jones will take the HR lead for EWS Americas. Robert will report to the EWS OTC. Jon Chapman has been appointed head of HR for EEL, based in London, and will report to the EEL OTC. Both Robert and Jon will report to David from a functional HR perspective. Additional realignment of resources will enable our team to further improve daily employee services, partner with Business Unit initiatives and maximize opportunities for commercialization. These modifications are as follows: ? Scott Gilchrist will lead HR for the newly formed EGAS. As such he will focus his attention on the asset positions in South America, Latin and Central America, the Middle East and Asia. The European assets will continue to be a part of EEL. Scott will also work closely with Rebecca McDonald and Sandip Mallick in relation to our assets in India. Scott will report to the EGAS OTC, Rebecca McDonald and David as above. ? Michelle Cash has agreed to take the lead of the Corporate OLER function for an interim period to determine how it should operate and be organized. She will report to me for this particular function, but of course will remain primarily a part of the EWS legal function reporting to Mark Haedicke. ? Sheila Walton will lead the HR Generalist activities for all Corp functions. Jo Ann Hill, and all of the corporate generalist functions currently under Jo Ann, will report to Sheila Walton. Sheila will continue to report to David. ? Sarah Davis will add the Click at Home program to her current responsibilities, and will continue to report to me. "

        "content": " rsanders.nsf Richard, The only significant deposition this week is taking place in Minneapolis. The deponent is Arthur Cobb, a disclosure/due diligence expert retained by Robins, Kaplan in several cases in which Enron is not named. Mr. Cobb's report did not mention ECT Securities, and the California plaintiffs did not designate him to testify in the CA cases, so we decided not to attend his deposition. We are getting daily transcripts by e-mail. Next week an expert designated by the CA plaintiffs on causation and damage issues is being deposed in San Francisco. Roland has a scheduling conflict, so I am sending Jonathan Goldblatt. The subject on which we want to ask questions is damages relating to certain purchases by Farallon after the initial offering. This is a very discrete area, easy to understand, and Jonathan is on top of it. I believe that you recently received a bill from Gerry McGrath. Gerry worked very hard on his report, putting in about 50% more hours than he thought he would when he agreed to cap the total fee for his report. He is very focused on the requirement in his engagement letter that he be paid in 30 days. I think Gerry did quite a good job, and we definitely need his best effort going forward. I would urge Enron to pay Gerry's bill very promptly. Farallon is currently threatening to move to compel further answers to interrogatories from us. It is much ado about nothing. We just want to deal with it in the least expensive way. Many of the plaintiffs have filed motions around the country, including in CA, seeking to compel Natwest to produce more audio tapes of employee conversations. My guess is that the plaintiffs have found more good stuff, and Natwest is trying to limit their losses. We are hard at work on the research that you and I have been discussing. It is frankly quite complex and involves several unanswered questions of law. The problem is that CA has a special statutory contribution provision (pro rata, not relative fault) in the state securities statutes and a common law doctrine of partial indemnity in tort actions that is based on relative fault. The later doctrine may not apply to the securities causes of action against ECT Securities, but definitely applies to the common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation causes of action. How all of this works together is virtually uncharted. With reference to your question about procedures at trial, none of the defendants has cross-complained against the other defendants for a determination of relative fault in the pending case; and, on the basis of the current pleadings, no such determination will be made at trial. If Enron goes to trial and loses, along with others, theoretically the plaintiffs could collect their entire judgment from Enron and leave Enron to pursue the other defendants, post-trial, for their respective shares of the liability, whether such shares are determined pro rata or by relative fault. We are working on a memorandum or outline that will lay all of this out for you. I think you will find that Enron has some powerful incentives to settle (assuming that we can get the price low enough.)

The purchase price of the transformer ($786,000) was taken from the WLB financing book and does not include any of the capitalized interest charges or option payment (total $56,803) allocation that Global Finance has included in the calculation of the Payoff #. The full cost of the transformer would be $842,803. 3. The purchase price of each turbine ($14,072,000) was calculated as an average cost based upon a spreadsheet provided by GE. This price does not include the $280,000 in change order costs allocated to each machine. The full cost of each turbine should be $14,352,000.

Item (4) should read \"The payment of a \"project fee\" equal to 2% of the project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in Exhibit B to this letter. Exhibit A should read as follows: Individual milestones subject to \"project fee\" payments: 1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. (\"Haywood Power\"), the abandonment by the Tennessee Valley Authority (\"TVA\") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of its Haywood County, Tennessee facility (\"Lagoon Creek\"), which results in Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement. 2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of $5 million. Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the $175,000 project fee shall be paid. 3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. (\"Calvert\"), the elimination of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 500kV transmission line from Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Calvert. Exhibit B should read as follows: The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a \"Development Project\"). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be deemed to be an approved Development Project (an \"Approved Project\"). For purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial operation of the Approved Project. For the avoidance of doubt, a project fee shall not be payable for any Development Project unless it becomes an Approved Project as defined herein. "

In the future, we will not be generally requiring legal opinions to be delivered with the Deemed Isdas (we may however require them on a case by case basis). We will still require legal opinions with the Master Agreements. Also, as you all know one of the problems to get from Mexican counterparties is the agent for service of process. In the future we will be sending as part of our package the names, fees and form of contracts for three agents for service of process. All the Mexican counterparties need to do is to choose one, sign the contract (it is normally one page by fax) and send it in. Because this will expedite our counterparties getting agents for service of process, I will start to ask for such information both in the Deemed Isda and the Master. Finally, I just contacted the confirm desk to ask them to, in the future, always inform me of any Deemed Isdas they get executed from mexican counterparties. Like this I can know and let you know exactly who is signing these documents and who is not. Ideally, we should get these back within a matter of two to three days. If not we should at least attempt to start contacting the counterparties. Just in case you are wondering why I am so concerned about the deemed Isda. Before we have a Deemed Isda executed, if there is a problem, I will have to litigate in Mexico under Mexican law (ENA does not like this option). Only after I get an executed Deemed Isda, I am out of Mexican courts and Mexican law. let me know if you have any questions and or suggestions to optimize our process.

Peter Leier asked me to work with you on progressing this master in his absence. Please note that the credit provisions reflect the discussions that each of our credit departments have had over the last several months. The guarantees referred to here have already been negotiated in the context of another deal (which will be brought under the umbrella of this Master when it is executed), and they are due to be executed and delivered by each party very soon. We have included our standard provision that will bring all outstanding transactions listed on Attachment A under the terms of the EEI MAster, but we have not included an attachment yet b/c there may be several outstanding transactions by the time we execute this master. Also note that my comments have borrowed heavily on the provisions of the ISDA agreement and schedule that I understand is being executed this week between Engage and Enron North America Corp. For example, you had checked the box on the Cover Sheet electing sec. 2.4 to apply, but that provision would be inconsistent with the ISDA Schedule 5(e). We believe it is preferable to follow the basic structure of the EEI documentation as other industry members are doing, leaving the \"boilerplate\" Master unmarked and putting all the changes at the end of the Cover Sheet, and so that's where you'll see the standard language that Enron adds to the Master. We believe that, true to the bilateral nature of these arrangements, such changes benefit both parties. Rather than attaching a separate Supplement, we would add to the Cover Sheet the changes you proposed in the Supplement after we've negotiated those changes. Please call me with any questions or comments. Regards, Janice EB3811 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax: 713-646-3490)"

If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to be what I would call an \"autoborrow\" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is swept into an account. Each day: (i) if Enovate's cash position is short (and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied towards the outstanding loan balances, if any. We'll need to get minimum target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each loan?) from the business people. Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational headache). Once you confirm the single lender part, that will be enough preliminary information for me to start on a loan agreement."

        "content": "Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Dear Jane, Reviewing your comments, our current position is as follows. Part 1 (b) US$50,000,000 Basically our company=10_fs guideline for the Threshold Amount is US$1,000,000 but it seems very small for significant customers and we can change it to US$10,000,000. As this amount is usually agreed in the Master Agreement with major commercial banks, we hope this is acceptable to you, too. John - is there any way we can accept this? I think it is going to be difficult to get them to agree so, if you still can't accept it, is there any way you can agree to the 10 million limit if at the same time something else is changed? (g) As for (1), we would like to add =10_gthe obligations of such resulting, surviving, or transferee entity hereunder are guaranteed by Enron Corp.=10_h in 5th line after =10_gEnron Corp.=10_h IBJ could accept to continue the Transactions with the counterparty when it merges with the other company and becomes materially weaker if the surviving company is guaranteed by Enron Corp. Sara - Do you think we can accept this? We would not be agreeing necessarily to give a corporate guarantee, but instead would have the option of putting one in place to avoid a default. If the concept is OK on your side, I think we should add \"hereunder\" as indicted above or something to restrict the obligations which need to be guaranteed. Sara, I would also like to add a \")\" after \"party\" at the end of line 4 of paragraph (g) of Part 1 of the Schedule. OK? Regarding (2), please delete it because it refers to Credit Support Annex which we are not going to enter into for the time being Sara - the question is whether we just delete the language or replace it with something else. The second option would be better and given the discretionY would have in this situation IBJ should not object provided the drafting works. Do you have any ideas of anything which would work within the framework of the rest of the schedule and the master? The final sentence should go anyway I guess. John - I guess you may need to consider above with Sara. (h) Agreed. (k) Agreed. Part 3 Regarding further document for certification, we can include the following language. =10_gAny certificate or document reasonably requested by the other party evidencing or certifying that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the party requested has been duly authorized=10_h I think this sounds OK. As for annual report, we will revert to you. John - As you can see from my memo, as a starting point, I have asked them to tell us what they have available re financials and will revert when I hear back from them to see what you think. Part 4 (a) Agreed. (f) Even if there are 20 Transactions between us which settle on the same day, our operation can not net the payment of the same currency. Our system does not allow the payment netting of more than one Transaction. John - They want to delete \"not\" from this provision. I think we need to assume that they are telling us the truth and that they just can't do it. The question is then, do we delete \"not\" or do we delete the entire paragraph (f) from Part 4 of the schedule. Pls let me know what you want to do.' (h) New York Branch address 1251 Avenue of The Americas, New York, NY 10020, U.S.A. Part 5 (a) When an option buyer who fully paid the premium goes bankrupt, we believe it will be more practicable that the other party (option seller) terminate a transaction according to Section 6(a) and pay the amount payable under Section 6(e), if any, to the option buyer. If option seller does not terminate the transaction, it sounds unnatural that the option seller pay the remaining payment on each payment date to the receiver of the defaulting party (option buyer). =10_@We do not usually include the safety net provision for a technical default. Even if payment default due to operational error, there is ample (three days) grace period for nonpayment party after receiving the notice of non-payment by the other party. Sara - what do you think, how flexible do you think we can be on this? (e) Agreed. (g) I understand the benefit that non-defaulting party could setoff its Affiliate=10_fs obligation against defaulting party=10_fs obligation. But in Japan only setoff between the parties who entered into the Agreement is allowed. If you know the case that in any country an applicable law permits to setoff the amount owed by the non-defaulting party=10_fs Affiliate against the amount owed by the defaulting party, please let us know. Sara - any comments? I am checking whether what they saying about Japanese law is true. (h) As we should also obtain our Credit Department=10_fs approval of credit line for the transferee before agreeing the transfer, we would like to insert the following words at the end of a new Section 7(c). =10_gAnd provided, further, that the transferring party has notified non-transferring party of the proposed transfer and the non-transferring party has not objected to the proposed transfer within 20 days of such notification, it being understood that the sole grounds for objection shall be the non-transferring party=10_fs good faith belief that the proposed transfer would give rise to an adverse tax, regulatory or, legal or internal credit policy consequences or material credit concerns to the non-transferring party, or that necessary internal credit approval has not been granted=10_h Sara - As noted in my memo to them, I had thought we may be willing to add to the end of this paragraph \"and provided that the transfer does not cause any adverse tax consequences for the other party in relation to which the transferring party is not willing to indemnify the other party.\" They have asked us to go far further than this now and I am not sure that we should be willing to agree to anything after \"legal\" in line 6 given that the guarantee provision should give their credit department comfort. Part 6 We can accept (a), (b) and (e) but cannot agree with (c),(d),(f),(g) and (h). Sara - your thoughts? If you have any question or uncertainty about the above items, please let me know.

EPMI was active in this proceeding, arguing that the merging companies have transmission market power and that FERC should require the companies to mitigate that market power before approving the merger. EPMI proposed that the companies be required to form a TransCo before the merger could be approved. Although the Commission did not require the companies to form a TransCo before approving the merger, the Commission did agree with many issues raised by EPMI and other intervenors, and the Commission adopted the testimony submitted by Enron and two other intervenors on this issue of market power (rather than adopting the rebuttal testimony submitted by AEP where AEP attempts to prove that it will not have market power after the merger). Specifically, the Commission found that the merged entity will have market power, so it ordered the companies to join a FERC-approved RTO by the Order No. 2000 deadline (i.e., December 15, 2001). Under Order No. 2000, an RTO can be a TransCo, an ISO, or some hybrid of the two. Furthermore, the Commission found that because the companies' market power will not be eliminated until the RTO is up and running, interim mitigation measures are also needed during the period prior to RTO membership. Specifically, FERC requires the companies to turn over the duties of calculating and posting ATC to an independent third party (a suggestion made by EPMI), and also directs AEP to provide generation dispatch information to an independent market monitor in order to monitor AEP's generation activity. The Commission orders AEP to respond to FERC within 15 days of whether AEP is prepared to accept these conditions. We will continue to monitor this proceeding and we will notify you of any significant developments. Please call me if you have any questions. "

Frankly, unless and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations are, it is difficult if not impossible to prepare documentation. For example: (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee they were expecting from Enron Corp.

However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank. (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law. However, I now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law. (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable. (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to Enron Canada. Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal opinions. (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine. I suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable. (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed. (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank. This presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults. At the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be capable of being set-off. We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements. (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent upon a final understanding of the swap structure. (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap structure. Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate \"fee letter\" to recover its fees. More problematically, the Bank was not clear as to how \"increased costs\" would be accounted for in the swap structure. Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those increased costs are flowed through. They were not sure how this could be accommodated in a swap structure. I suggested that there may be some way to fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes or through a separate indemnification in the \"fee letter\". (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank. For example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the Bank in connection with the transaction. Of course this depends on finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants package. In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper as soon as possible. Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning. Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external expectations. It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday morning. Regards, Peter"

        "content": " jdasovic.nsf Colleagues: Stella Chan, Pat Keene and Harry Kingerski would like to communicate a streamlined process to provide Government and Regulatory support to URM (Utility Risk Management). The process strives to bring GA in the different regions, in Houston and URM much closer to each other to provide and implement GA service as completely, and cost-effectively as possible. The suggested process includes four steps, namely: Curve validation Process, Quantifying of Regulatory Risks/Change, Coordination of Strategy Development, and Coordination of Strategy Implementation. A description of these functions are as follows: Curve Validation Process: This process aims at reviewing, and validating, every 90 days, the regulatory inputs of: a) the largest 60 curves in Enron's books, and b) the new deals that are under approval during the review period. The curve validation process is currently in progress and GA personnel in Houston and the regions are already involved. Quantification of Regulatory Risks/Change: This process aims at quantifying--in dollars terms--the impact of the change in the regulatory inputs on a specific position. The model is now in place, and test is in progress. This process will involve initiation by GA regional personnel (also possibly by URM) with potential regulatory changes that may impact EES positions. The quantification exercise will be done jointly by URM and GA. Coordination of Strategy Development: The outcome of curve validation and quantification of regulatory risks--functions 1, and 2 above--will likely call for a group of regulatory measures and action items. The function of Stella and Pat is to coordinate and facilitate strategy sessions in association with the owner of the curve in URM, and her/his counterparts in Midwest/Midsouth, Atlantic Seaboard, the Western Region, and Texas & Oklahoma Ercot, and SPP. The strategy sessions shall come up with suggested action items, probability of success, and likely associate costs for implementation. Stella and Pat shall be responsible for seeking the buy-off, and approval, of the strategy from URM and securing the needed budget, if necessary. Coordination of Strategy Implementation: Once the strategy is approved, it shall enter the implementation stage. The role of Stella and Pat is to coordinate between URM requests/positions and their counterparts in the regions. As the case now, they shall continue supporting the regions in the implementation as needed. To facilitate these functions Stella and Pat shall emulate the coverage lines of the URM. Stella shall coordinate the Eastern Region, while Pat shall coordinate the Western Region. These regions do not follow the conventional wisdom, and need to be specifically defined. They are: Eastern Region: ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, NJ, PA, MD, DE, VA, WV, NC, SC, GA, AL, TE, KY, and FL. Western Region: The remaining states (including OH in the east). From the Regional perspective, the process will naturally be overseen by the Regional Directors (i.e., Steve, Janine, Jean, and Paul), meanwhile, Harry shall oversee it from Houston side. The process, however, is designed to give regional managers and GA in Houston as much autonomy as possible and shall make the least possible demand on the time and work load of the regional directors (usually in the final sprint for approvals). Stella, Pat, and Harry shall visit you shortly to discuss the details of the processes outlined above and listen to your comments and advise. I shall contact you to take your suggestion for the most appropriate time for you and your group. Of course, please let me know if you have any question and/or advise. Brgrds AI 713-853-3037 "

        "content": "Update - Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes (importers excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk) for a period of two weeks. During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a efficient market. In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with the premise that there is a \"problem\" that requires \"emergency\" amendments to the Pool rules. Our position has been that Alberta is short supply, and significant changes to the rules and/or market design will only discourage new generation development. Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address and what the process will be. We discussed the process and it appears he will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a small committee of 4-5 stakeholders (which would include Enron) to work with the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules. Dale said he would try to pull together a \"terms of reference\" document that would define the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow. After my call with Dale McMaster, Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas: 1) Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released (and assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee) Blakes will assist us with preparing a letter that states that Enron's participation does not represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing in Alberta and that Enron's participation on the committee is on a without prejudice basis; 2) Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes: i) would introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market, ii) would be contrary to the development of an efficient, fair and openly competitive market for electricity, iii) would compromise the independence of the Power Pool, and iv) would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the real time price of electricity in Alberta. Once Blakes receives a copy of the Frontier Economics memo, they will prepare a memo for Enron advising: i) whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative tribunal operating in Alberta; and ii) whether such rule changes offend the provisions of the EUA; 3) Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse (i.e. appeal to the AEUB, and/or legal action in the Court of Queen's Bench) in the event the proposed rule changes (or similar changes) are approved by the PPC at the end of this two week period. GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any possible legal remedies. Please advise if you have any comments. Regards, Rob "

Just a few additional thoughts: 1. Since we will be redoing all of the existing confirms to refer to this Master, I did not change the language that states that conflicts between the Confirms and the Agreement are resolved in favor of the Confirm. I think that the language as written works. 2. On the setoff language, when we are the Non-Defaulting Party, we can only pull in other agreements between our affiliates and inland so I don't see how this language would impact any agreements between ENA and guaranty Bank unless Inland is the Non-Defaulting party. 3. With respect to Disruption Fallbacks, our view is that if the Confirm specifies a Fallback reference Price that after Postponement, you would use that price if available. I think that the language works as drafted. 4. On cash collateral, the Qualified institution concept only applies when the non-posting party is a Defaulting party or has a Credit rating below the threshold. Otherwise the non-posting party can hold the collateral and do whatever it wants to with it.

        "content": "Carolan redeployment to LNG group I am very pleased that Dominic has been offered an opportunity to re-deploy from EGEP to the LNG legal group upon the completion of his current assignment in the disposition of Enron's China E&P assets. As you know, we have been going through the data-room process and we will be calling for final bids on April 9th. Dominic is finalizing the draft PSA and associated bidding documents at this time. We plan to distribute a copy of such to all potential bidders by the end of the week. At this time we have 15 companies that have signed the CA and are at various stages in the evaluation process. We believe we have 7-8 serious bidders and we hope to get at least 3-4 bids submitted on the 9th. To complicate the process a little, we have 3 majors seriously evaluating both the E&P properties and the old EI China pipeline project. We are coordinating with Chris Hunt, Bill Krenz and Keith Stepp on the integrated sale of both assets with this select group of companies. In addition to the current drafting work, we will have a few additional data-room visitors prior to the 9th, due diligence requests and, of course, definitive agreement negotiations to conclude before the process is complete. The reason I outlined the above is to give all concerned parties a feel for the process we need Dominic to participate in (to varying degrees) until it is concluded. There will be times where this project will require 100% of his time for several days and then other times where there will be a few days with no pressing issues. However, to avoid any confusion over the next couple of months I thought it would be a good idea to lay out a few ground rules for Dominic's time. 1) EGEP supports Dominic re-deploying to the LNG group and will strive to get him 100% transferred as soon as practical. 2) During the next couple of months Dominic will have some \"dead time\" in the China disposition and during this time we are supportive of Dominic spending time with the LNG group, getting up to speed with the activities in the group and taking on low-priority assignments that could be delayed if his time was needed in the sale process. 3) The only assignment Dominic has to complete with EGEP is the sale of the China assets. There will be no future assignments. 4) Until EGEP senior management releases Dominic to the LNG group, his primary responsibility will be the China sale and this activity will take precedence over any other assignments. 5) Until EGEP senior management releases Dominic to the LNG group, his primary office will remain in 3 Allen Center with EGEP. He is expected to report to 3 Allen Center and the daily 8:30 am disposition meeting to ascertain any sale related needs for his time. This meeting usually lasts for 30-45 minutes and if there are no issues he can report to the LNG group. In some ways I know this appears to be a little silly. However, I also know that if we don't set out a few rules we will encounter a problem and it is not fair to Dominic or in Enron's best interest to let Dominic take on two \"A-priority\" projects at this time. We need his services to successfully sell this project. Unfortunately, we can not schedule when certain activities will be needed, but we will be reasonable whenever possible to allow for a smooth effort in both groups. During the next couple of months I'm sure Dominic will be a very positive addition to your staff in spite of the time allocated to the China sale effort. He has been a very productive and valuable employee for our group and I am very glad Enron found a way to retain his services. If you have any questions please give me a call. Thanks for your support during this short-term need in our group. We will try to make this inconvenience as small as possible. jeff "

We are doing our best to operate on a business as usual basis, and continue the regular, consistent programs we previously provided. That is why earlier this year we paid performance bonuses and merit increases to most non-debtor employees, in the ordinary course of business. At the same time, I understand that events of the past few months have been disturbing and left many with a sense of uncertainty about their future. We realize that you need some sort of \"safety net\" to allow you to be comfortable staying here as we work to reorganize. With this in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have put in place a severance plan for U.S. employees of certain non-debtor companies. We have wanted this program for some time, but even as a non-debtor company we had to work extensively with consultants and creditors in securing its approval. The severance plan provides that, under most circumstances, terminated employees would be eligible for two weeks of base pay for every full or partial year of service. In the case of a termination due to reorganization, the minimum compensation would be eight weeks of pay and the maximum would be fifty-two weeks. The details and restrictions to this plan are explained in the plan summary for your company's plan, which can be found on the ETS HR link on the Enron Transportation Services intranet site under \"ETS HR Manuals\". It can also be accessed by clicking on the attached weblink: http://hrweb.enron.com/businessUnits/ets/etsHRmanuals.asp . I hope this plan will give you a bit more peace of mind and allow you to continue the excellent work you have been providing in our ongoing businesses.

IM Strategy Proposal. Steve Kean joined the task force for a project review and to discuss if one executive sponsor and one senior coordinator for IM should be appointed. Per Steve's recommendation, the task force should consider Steve as the executive sponsor for the project. No senior coordinator for the effort will be appointed until some incremental successes are achieved. Steve referenced the Louise Kitchen/Enron Online experience where Louise and team, independent of their day jobs, developed and launched Enron Online without budget or traditional sponsorship. We should continue operating in this vein. Steve will be available to place calls to the BU/FUs to rally support. Our focus should remain on identifying and developing sticky portal applications to improve the flow of information which ultimately should increase the flow of revenue. Steve's message to IM Task Force: do what it takes to make it happen. During the discussion with Steve, we reviewed HP's best practices portal. Steve would like to view the HP demonstration of their best practices portal. Assignment: Marie work with Maureen McVicker to identify a time Allan Sommer and HP are available for demo. Allan Sommer to arrange a demo of this application at next week's task force meeting. Assignment: All task force members are encouraged to generate \"killer\" application ideas. Be prepared to submit your list of five \"killer applications\" at next week's IM meeting. Note, Allen Elliott's IT team will need these next week to begin development work on these recommendations. Review Pegi Newhouse's list of HP portal applications below. Some features from the HP Portal which Price-Waterhouse Coopers demonstrated include: @HP Email Voice mail Fax Stocks Weather Corporate News (which remains on everyone's page---it can't be taken off) Local News External News Nanny Cam Life HR Benefits (401K balance, detailed descriptions, etc. This was a link into their outsourced benefits provider Hewitt Assoc.) Life Events check lists -Marriage Checklist (what you processes/forms you will need to access--to save you time) -Divorce Checklist (a longer list than previous!) -Childbirth Checklist Moving Online forms Brokerage Firms to check fund performance and stock options HMO Info at a Glance Full Health Information Job Purchase Equipment Travel bookings PC tech support Skills Inventory (similar to expert finder) Personal Career Gap analysis (does gap analysis on what training you need to accomplish your goals) eLearning (based on your skills and position, it will suggest training you need with links to course info) Recruiting Package tracker (track your UPS, FedEx packages) Workspace Pending tasks Product Information Contacts My tool box (databases/ tools that you use, your applications) Workgroup tools (chat room) Calendar Org Chart Management Reports *Another important feature: Single Sign on! Many of these items link to external sites but it is all seamless to the user. Look & feel remains consistent throughout. NOTE: HP saw measurable benefits were realized when they were able to renegotiate their service agreement with their benefits provider (outsourced like ours) because people had all of the information at their fingertips and call volume decreased significantly.

Although I find this disappointing, we obviously need to address this development. We think the proper approach is to retain the firm recallable release structure we developed. That creates a present release into Enron's hands of the contracts, which was Barry's stated desire. We would retain a recall right BUT we could only exercise it in accordance with the Support Agreement (e.g., monthly, so long as not in default). We understand that you might want some further assurance that we would not misuse that right. To that end, I have resuscitated the Collateral Trust and Security Agreement. In other words, we would give you a first priority lien on the applicable transportation packages so that if we improperly recalled the capacity (which we of course would not), you would still be the senior secured party on the capacity and be entitled to exercise your remedies of foreclosure. Moreover, as Lisa and I discussed when we first considered the security interest, this security interest would be exempted from the automatic stay in accordance with Section 362(b)(17) of the Bankruptcy Code and thus you would be in a position to exercise your lien notwithstanding even the meltdown scenario of a bankruptcy.

We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

We have created an Excel Spreadsheet, with the time sheet form, and there is a tab for each of you, in alphabetical order by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is saved in O:\\Research\\Common\\SAP Timesheets\\MMM-DD. (MMM month and DD 15th or end of the month time period - i.e., this time period is 7/16 - 7/31/00). The regular 8 hour days have already been entered for each of you. Therefore, if you have no exceptions you just need to type in your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked (Emp Sign), and save it. If you do have exception time, simply open that particular pay period and show the exception time (off-duty,vacation, overtime, sick time, jury time, family time, etc.) that you may have had during that pay period. Some of the codes have already been entered for you, the rest are listed at the bottom of the spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever applies. If you are an exempt employee you need only show your off-duty time or exception time. If you are non-exempt you must show all hours worked and if you have overtime, you must add that to the 8 hours regular time. There is no code for non-exempt overtime. This should make it much easier for everyone. However, I will need you to fill out this timesheet form by the 13th and 29th of each month. I will try and remind you by email the day before. I would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation, HOD day, or any other off-duty that you know about before hand, that way if you are out of pocket for any reason and cannot fill in one of the forms, I will be able to fill in your timesheet for you.

The parties agreed to continue the CA talks at Treasury and to suspend the FERC process. The FERC chief judge and FERC staff attended the meetings at Treasury on Wednesday. The Tuesday meeting is called the meeting of \"principals.\" Apparent Process Tuesday meeting gave two assignments to us. (1) Develop framework for auction for long-term contracts and resolving QF issues (2) Develop framework for dealing with utility debt, including supplier \"forbearance\" Long-term contracts--Attended by Sue Mara -- After much debate, divided into three subgroups: (a) Timeline/Implementation (b) Utility Needs/Product definition/RFP development (c) Standard Contract Development -- Timeline -- I was the lead and we completed our assignment. We agreed on an aggressive schedule with power flowing by 2/1/01. The process is set up for DWR, working with a consultant. It's an RFP rather than an auction process. The idea of a mock auction was rejected. -- Product definition -- Much work needed here. Major issue set forth below. -- Contract -- Most parties (including Enron) want to use the EEI standard contract. Group working on additional provisions. Plan final contract by Friday. Utility Debt -- Attended by Sarah Novosel -- Report later Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts NEW MAJOR ISSUE: Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they want the State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that this had been their idea all along. In their view, the utilities provide a forecast and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of the utilities. They were unwilling to commit to any time frame. Kind of Auction or RFP -- a.k.a What does the Governor really want? Many people in the room believe that the Governor was firm in his demand for 5.5 cent power for ALL the unmet load of the utilities. We spent four hours debating these issues. In the end, the parties felt that the best approach would be to have simulataneous auctions as follows: -- Separate bids for NP 15 and SP 15 -- RFP 1 -- Suppliers submit bids for more than one product with a blended price of 5.5 cents. -- RFP 2 -- (Considered closest to the Gov's proposal) State sets price of 5.5 cents and suppliers compete on term and volume. --RFP3 -- Suppliers provide bids for any of the utilities' product needs and are free to bid any price, volume or term. -- All RFPs would be conducted simultaneously. Parties agree that RFP3 is most likely to get the greatest number of bids. Next Steps Meetings continue on Thursday Plan is to have final documents ready for the next meeting of the principals Principals tentatively set to meet on Friday or Saturday."

HR (Sheila Walton) told me last week that I need not to worry about vesting in the plan since we will officially still be Enron employees as long as we are getting paid severance. With the latest information we got this seems to be questionable now. HR and Benefits do not seem to know what is going on now; all my questions remained unanswered when I called them this morning. Benefits stated that as long as my termination date was after the 9th of December I would vest. HR doesn't seem to know when my official termination date is. If needed, I have more than 10 days of unused vacation; I could be deemed on vacation and terminated after the 9th. I would like to ask you to help me with this matter and try to set my termination date after December 9, i.e. at the earliest next Monday.

        "content": "Re: RTO West Meeting of January 12 Alan, Thanks for the update. I think the amount of time we allocate to the RTO West, and the extent we coordinate with other marketers, has to be reevaluated in light of what is going on in California. The California blow up is bound to raise some serious concerns in the Northwest (the e-mail from the PPC guy is probably the first of many), as well it should. I think a driving concern we should have, particularly now, is that the primary objective of the RRG is to lay the framework for a successful market place and to NOT try and solve all problems and get mired down in complexities and software limitations. I would argue the intial RTO framework has to be simple and adaptable. What is it exactly Enron wants? Do we want all control areas collapsed, a ancillary service market, a non-contract-path-based congestion management system? Why? How prudent is it to forge ahead while California is in such disarray? Is the goal to just comply with FERC, or to create something that will provide a basis for a sound market in (initially) a simple easily-understood manner? Can we get 85% of what we want without multiple congestion runs, markets driven by software, weird FTRs, and disconnected cash and real-time markets? I would argue we should advocate simplicity. What gives us the biggest bang for our buck coming out of the gate? Deal with that, implement it, see how it works, adjust as necessary, and then move on. The danger now is that people see California and deregulation as one in the same. They are not going to trust complicated changes, and it is going to be difficult to assure them they will work. We should be able to specifically lay out the top 5 issues we have with the way the Northwest market is structured now, why it costs money and/or is inefficient from a market perspective, and what simple steps could be taken to resolve these issues. I think we should become adept at explaining exactly why the California market did not work, and why the California market is not synonymous with deregulation and open, competitive markets. We may even want to sponsor some sort of conference. My bottom line is, I guess, is that I would like us to advocate smart changes for the sake of a sound market (even if they are simple and straight-forward), and not so much get hung up on what FERC thinks open-access is or should be.

We tried to resolve these errors immediately but with out success. I believe a clean resolution will take another month to achieve. Recognizing the urgency of getting power products up and running I am requesting we immediately advance with the establishment of an offshore financial product via Enron North America. This is the quickest way to get flexible power products online. To achieve this end we need to immediately address the contract format of a financial agreement we are capable of contracting under in Argentina today. I request the legal and commercial teams address this issue and develop a solution as soon as possible. We will then roll out the product we have already designed to meet the needs of the current market. We will need to coordinate with Enron North America and facilitate as much as possible to avoid conflicting with their objectives. Please initiate the process of getting Argentina power online as soon as possible. MFG "

Doug Sewell, who participates on the MAIN Planning Committee, was on a call this morning in which members of MAIN and NERC's Virginia Sulzberger discussed ways to limit access to information. A new disturbing angle was that apparently, some members indirectly alleged that marketers have \"higher turnover\" and \"loose lips,\" and were using this as a scare tactic to indicate why the information should be restricted (potentially even from legitimate consumers like us). If I remember correctly, we were going to contact NERC to let them know our opinions on this issue. It sounds like perhaps they are not being addressed sufficiently. Doug has suggested we should being it up at the MAIN MIC meeting; do we want to begin a campaign to protect our access to this data?

We recognize that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron's business goals, and we are pleased that many of you have shared in the company's financial success through Enron stock options. As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program. Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron's continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package. On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program). It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, is as follows: ? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations. ? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.) ? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000. ? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant of stock options. Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program, among other good reasons=01( that's why. In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your questions, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your Human Resources representative. Note: In addition to final approval by Enron's Board of Directors, granting of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron companies' employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refine the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

As always, if you have any questions, please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron. Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an in-person meeting down in your office. 1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated. In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change. 2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing mechanism and then apply it consistently. 3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to handle this production. 4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000 invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over, and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.

When you log on to LNX, a set of instructions will lead you to the most recent version of the contract. To review and revise the contract you will download the document onto your PC or LAN. 2. Consistent with normal drafting, you will need to save your revised version of the contract on your system, under a new name. 3. When you are ready to provide your revised version of the contract to the rest of the team, you will upload the your document onto LNX. Peter Thompson will receive an automatic email from LNX each time a team member uploads a revised document. 4. When Peter has incorporated the various revisions proposed by the team, he will upload the resulting revision cycle on LNX. Each team member will receive an automatic email notification when Peter uploads the latest and greatest version of the contract. Additionally, you will not have to redline your document for the group, LNX will handle redlining for us, it's automatic, too.

No new deals should be executed with PACE Global Energy Services, LLC until credit has reviewed and assessed a credit line, etc. I have asked Deal Validation to have these deals moved back to where they were originally booked to (Alcoa, Inc.).

Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year. Below is my update on a few GISB matters. We'll go into more detail at our next meeting. ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB) The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions. The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB). The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual. In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB. GISB REPRESENTATON Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001. Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board. Her term expires December 31, 2003. My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003. ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete. The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002. This is probably a firm date. The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed. GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards. The errors in the standards books are extensive. The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books. I am working to have GISB correct the standards books. Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version. Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books. I'll let you know what is decided. Thanks, Theresa"

        "content": "CONFERENCE CALL MONDAY AT 3:00 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL I was asked to set up a conference call for Monday (3/19) at 3:00 Eastern with regulatory and bankruptcy counsel for the nine Complainants to discuss the interrelation between the FERC Chargeback complaint proceeding (and the Amendment 22 matter), the District Court case before Judge Moreno, and the Bankruptcy proceeding, and to discuss strategy. Dial-in #: 1-800-403-2008 Participants #: 143570 The following issues have been identified as issues for discussion: 1. Likelihood that Bankruptcy Court will grant PX motion to modify stay; including feasibility and effort by parties to file answer in support of motion, including whether it would be realistic to request that the PX's motion be considered on a more expedited basis (PX asked for 3/30 hearing date) in light of the FERC Complaint proceeding; 2. Status and approach for possible settlement with PX for release of collateral assuming Bankruptcy Court modifies stay. 3. Feasibility of asking Bankruptcy Court to immediately release all collateral in excess of amount needed to satisfy (1) vendors, (2) existing and anticipated future defaults of SCE and PG&E, and (3) reasonable costs. In this regard, does anyone have a handle on whether the collateral exceeds the total of the foregoing matters? 4. Any comments on (1) answer to PX answer to Complaint, and (2) answer to PX request for clarification in Amendment No. 22 proceeding; including the timing of such filings with FERC. This email does not address bankruptcy counsel for all parties. If you wish to have your client's bankruptcy counsel on the call, please inform them of the time and relevant information for the call. This call will likely be extremely unwieldy, so I would request the parties to consolidate their participants where possible. Also, please do not forward this information as it addresses confidential litigation matters. Thanks. See you Monday. Ron "

        "content": "BlueDog Change Order #2, Rev 5 Brian, The following are our comments to the subject change order. If you like, we can set up a time to discuss these comments. As I mentioned on the phone, many of the comments directed at Part 1, Item 1 are due to the fact I do not have a signed copy of Consent to Assignment. I am searching for a copy at this end, but if you have ready access, a copy would be appreciated. Part I 1. The base contract defines the party GE is contracting with as the \"Purchaser\". LJM2is the Purchaser under the base contract. I understand assignment of the contract by LJM2 to E-Next is under consideration and was supposed to have occurred in December. I do not have a copy of the Consent signed by GE or any other signed documents indicating that the assignment has taken place. Assuming the assignment has taken place, according to the unsigned documentation I have, Enron North America Corp. should be replaced as the contracting party in paragraph 1 by E-Next Generation LLC as the party that is contracting with GE and is the Purchaser. As I understand the draft Consent agreement, Enron North America is supposed to be the Agent for E-Next and is not the Purchaser. This is consistent with the cover page of the draft CO No. 2. Revision 5 to the Change Order does not quite succeed in making the correction. It should say \"... between General Electric Company (\"Seller\") and E-Next Generation LLC (\"Purchaser\") dated May 31, 2000 (the \"Agreement\"), Purchaser, acting through its Agent, Enron North America Corp., hereby amends ...\". However, CO No. 2 with this correction to paragraph 1 should not be signed by GE until GE has agreed to the assignment to E-Next. Otherwise, the signed CO. No. 2 could, by itself, be construed as consent by GE to the assignment. 2.1 Delete the added language that begins with the words \"on or prior to the Guaranteed Unit Shipment Date(s)...\". Because Unit No. 1 is going to storage and the customer controls when it is released from storage and when it gets to the jobsite, the risk of late delivery originally assigned by the contract to GE has shifted to the customer. This is recognized in section 5.5.2 of the contract which states that if GE is directed to ship to storage, for the purpose of assessing LDs and final payment, GE's delivery obligation is deemed fulfilled. The original guaranteed delivery dates are no longer relevant. If the Unit 1 equipment is close enough to being ready for delivery that it must be shipped to storage because the customer cannot take possession of it, it does not matter if we ship to storage before or after the contract delivery dates. 2.2 The comment to 2.1 applies to this paragraph also. Further, there is no guaranteed delivery date for non-Major Components as long as delivery of that equipment does not impede the continuous progress of installation. 2.4 Delete the words \"unless caused by Seller or its Subcontractor\" at the end of this paragraph. Otherwise, the paragraph first takes a responsibility away from GE and then re-imposes it. As I understand it, there is a significant possibility that some cosmetic deterioration to external surfaces will occur to the equipment while it is in storage. This is a function of the storage conditions and GE is responsible for those conditions. 2.6 Delete in its entirety the second sentence which reads \"Passage of title and warranty obligations of Seller with respect to the Unit 1 Equipment remain unchanged under the Agreement\". Article 5.5.2 makes it clear that Purchaser's direction to place equipment into storage causes title to pass and delivery for the purposes of LDs and final payment to occur even though Purchaser has not taken physical possession of the stored equipment. 5.5.2 also indicates that all expenses incurred by Seller as the result of placing equipment into storage shall be payable by Purchaser. These expenses include any extension of the Primary Warranty Period that results from storage. The deleted sentence should be replaced by: \"The parties agree that the Primary Warranty Period for Unit 1 Equipment placed into storage shall be determined in accordance with Article 14.1.1 of the Agreement except that the Primary Warranty Period shall end for the gas turbine and generator no later than March 11, 2004 and for the balance of the Unit 1 Equipment on March 31, 2004 unless extended by mutual agreement.\" 2.10 We will insure the equipment to 100% of its purchase price. The policy in place will have a $300,000 deductible, for which GE will be responsible. 2.11 Seller's responsibility for both damage and loss, not just loss, should pass to Purchaser. The rest of the changes are acceptable. Regards, Jeff "

Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day out right to Enron. That being said, I think that we have a short window to push for DA before any public action impacts us in Sacramento. I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it harder for our advocacy on DA, but real $ are flowing out of the company. EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

        "content": "Eon in the US; NExt Steps Tom: Just to recap what we discussed to make sure I understand. Next Steps 1. You have asked counsel from Akin, Gump to analyse the possible options we may have to intervene at a the federal regulatory level in the Eon take-overs. Possible avenues are the FERC and the SEC. I understand that you and she will also carefully examine any options we mave via the USTR - which may prove to be our strongest hand. She will provide you with an assessment of the various options and risks to these options in the course of the next week or so. As you know, Andreas and I have spoken to Steffes, Shapiro, and Frevert - all of whom were supportive of this idea and so no marked risk to our relationship with Eon or possible 2. Akin Gump will also file an intervention on our behalf with the FERC re the Eon acquisition of LG&E by no later than cob Monday to provide us with a place holder in the proceedings should we wish to act. We will jointly contact Shaw on Monday to let him know that this is being done. 3. Building from our meetings in Washington, Russ Kean from Kissinger and Associations will draft up an initial \"political leverage\" program which would cover the following: what goals we might realistically achieve by engaging senior US politicians in the issue of energy market opening in Germany and equal treatment for American companies; what key messages would we want to develop to generate high-level political interest in this; what politicians and decision-makers should we want to approach, how should the messages be presented, and how can we galvanise political action (possible targets would be the US Trade Rep,. the White House/ VP Cheney, key members of Congress, US Assistant Secretaries at State and possibly Commerce, and local politicians in Kentucky) 4. You and I can then pull this material together into a coherent presentation for Eric and other senior folk in London to present the program of how, in a graduated fashion, we can apply increasing pressure on Eon to seek their co-operation and or acquiesance in regulatory areas such as unbundling, regulated TPA, and reciprocity as well as commercial issues such as tolling agreements, and long-term interconnector capacity. Mark Frevert has offered to raise any of this with Harig (head of Eon) if and when we want. 5. On a parallel path, we will continiue to get the message out that the German market is not open and US firms are suffering when John meets with the Congressional Delegation in Berlin next week and a meeting slated with the new US Ambassador (Coates) in Berlin later in September. Missing Items: 1. Do we have interest in also developing a PR angle to this program? It may be a bit premature, but, if so, we would need to work with Enron's PR agency to develop the messages we would want to get out, the vehicles for doing so, the localities to hit, and the follow-up. 2. We still need more detail from (Shaw, Thompson, and Radmacher) on exactly what their commercial priorities are and how to balance these with regulatory objectives. 3. An assessment for options at the state regulatory level. 4. Have meetings yet been set up with USTR? This is a key pressure point. Let me know what other thoughts you may have and let's talk tomorrow afternoon. Thanks, Paul "

        "content": " gnemec.nsf John, Attached is the Transco guaranty with further revisions. The following items of note were revised. 1. Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty. Enron will only provide a payment guaranty. Enron does not have the means to ensure performance by the LLC. Thus the language needs to clearly identify that this is a payment guaranty. As long as Transco gets paid for the transport, I am not sure why this matters. 2. Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their tariff. Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the ability to recover double interest on late payments. Thus, the interest language in the guaranty was removed. Please review the revised guaranty. I would be happy to discuss these issues with Transco's attorney's at their convenience. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks. "

Haedicke FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net Corporation HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm Before the Internet you could not Shepardize for $4 or Keycite(r) for $3.75. You had to be a subscriber. Today all you need is a credit card. See, e.g.: http://www.westlaw.com/SubOptions/other.wl see also: http://web.lexis.com/xchange/Forms/uas/Catalog.asp In fact, everything published to http://www.westlaw.com and http://www.lexis.com is available on-demand whenever you cannot quickly find the right answer elsewhere for free, or for short money using TheLaw.net. Why is this significant and why would we advertise our competitors? Simple. With everything in the \"Wexis\" universe always just a click or two away on the Internet, you no longer need to pick and choose resources and interestingly, you no longer necessarily require expensive subscriptions. For years, the management question has been whether to make that onerous annual commitment to Company A or Company B. But thanks to the Internet, you can have just what you need, at the precise time you need it on a pay-per-view basis. Choosing the right tool for the job is the trick. But that's easy once you know your options. --USEFUL BELLS AND WHISTLES OR TEDIOUS OVERKILL? TheLaw.net Custom Browser lacks some of Wexis' bells and whistles. For instance, using our meta-searchable database of four million plus Federal and state appellate judicial opinions, you can quickly call up a relevant list of cases that have construed the statute, rule, reg or cite that you need to learn more about. It is just as easy to quickly jump to the relevant excerpt of each case to assess relevancy. What's missing are the little colored arrows indicating whether a Court followed or distinguished your case. For some, the lack of every conceivable enhancement can be a deal breaker. Others, however, prefer to draw their own conclusions by checking cases for themselves because at some point in their career something happened which caused them to question whether the best lawyers are the ones still writing headnotes. Depending on the job at hand, the mind numbing array of costly, high falutin' Wexis icons and symbols scattered throughout a document, may be very useful or very confusing and unnecessary. --THE INTERNET: AN INCUBATOR FOR CHOICE We advertise our competitors because we recognize that Wexis has been a work in progress for generations and we know that you will probably always have a relationship with them at some level; subscription, pay-per-view, or otherwise. Certainly, factors such as practice area, jurisdiction, organization size and culture all contribute to assembling what is, for you, the best matrix of tools for the job. Far be it from us to say precisely where we fit in. This, by definition, is an individualized decision only you can make as a sophisticated consumer of information services. Experience teaches, however, that by deploying TheLaw.net in your world: ----you may discover that your online productivity increases ten fold ----the list of expensive subscription items may be much shorter ----you may discover that it makes sense to use Wexis only a transaction basis We have subscribers who will tell you that this is a great way to run a business. Clients' expectations are set at the front end. You recover 100% of your costs on the back side and the embarrassment of finessing or eating unanticipated charges are added to what we hope is a long list of learning experiences. See, e.g., http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm General practitioners frequently see us as a sensible, low flat-rate go-to resource and when necessary, they supplement with Wexis. Specialists sometimes choose to cling to their elegant practice or jurisdiction specific slice of Wexis, adding us on as \"meter insurance\" for those occasions when The Plan doesn't cut.

As you will see, NewCo will be well positioned to be the market leading service provider to the Forest Products industry. Revenue generation opportunities exist from software ASP models/licensing, consulting engagements and in the transactional/logistics arena of the Exchange. More important, these supplier and buyer interactions all lead to increased funnel throughput for Clickpaper to EIM. There are tremendous network effects resulting from this full service, continuum of offerings. Relative to deal structure, the PEx management team remains open to identifying a structure that works for both Enron and ENW. This could be as simple as an outright purchase of PEx or slightly more complex merging of assets into NewCo. Per my comments at PaperWeek, if there is a deal to be done, arguably, it makes sense to combine interests prior to PEx making any other moves now under consideration. Let's determine, once and for all, if there is a leveragable position that meets the goals of Enron and will position NewCo to thrive as a significant player in the Forest Products industry.

Our current Global Asset Operations functions will be decentralized and become a business unit responsibility. Enron will continue to operate all of its facilities under standardized guidelines and procedures and compliance will be monitored through a formal audit program as in the past. However, our Wholesale Business Units will assume responsibility for operation and management of their specific power plants and other assets. Operational Energy Corporation (OEC) will become the Enron Corp =01&Center of Excellence=018 for power plant operations. The Gas Pipeline Group is the Center of Excellence=018 for pipeline operations. OEC will reside in Enron North America. Jim Noles will be in charge of this activity. Mark Dobler will lead operations; and John Cates will lead the Development Support Activity. John Cates' organization will continue to provide O&M estimates and due diligence assistance to business units. John will specifically approve O&M estimates for corporate risk assessment decisions. Jim Noles and this new group will report to the Office of the Chairman in Enron North America. The Quality Management Group (Audit Function) will be assigned to the Gas Pipeline Group (GPG). Don Hawkins will continue to head Quality Management and will report to Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Operations, GPG. In addition to managing the global audit program, Don will continue his responsibility for standardized policies and procedures, the Crisis Management Program, ISO 9000 certification, the Positive Impact Program, operational reporting, and the Asset Operations Website. The Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Group led by Henry Van will report to Mike Terraso, Enron's Chief Environmental Officer reporting to Steve Kean. As in the past, Henry's Group will continue to provide environmental and safety support to the regional business units. Enron's Wholesale Business Unit's can now choose from a variety of services provided by OEC. These include full turnkey O&M services, O&M estimates, due diligence, and technical support for planned and forced outages. Business units are encouraged to take advantage of these services as they operate and maintain the power plants in their businesses.

Please let me know as soon as possible whether this arrangement is acceptable. ? Second, as it turns out, Mark Desmarais and Randy Baldemor having been tracking the M/V OBOD and reporting back to a Seattle Washington law firm.?

Mark does not believe that our firm's monitoring the status of the vessel presents any conflicts with our representing ENRON.?

Assuming our firm is engaged by ENRON, given that they already know about the vessel, its recent history and the parties and counsel involved, Mark and Randy would appear best suited to assist you on this matter. ? Finally, I passed on to Mark your immediate concern that ENRON should not be viewed (because it missed a filing deadline or otherwise) as having abandoned its interest in the cargo of the M/V OBOD.?

But at least it highlights the rapid fall off starting in the March, when most of the customers had been returned to Bundled Utility Service. To obtain a more accurate projection of the receivable as of January 18, 2001 or at any point would require this information be sorted differently and require allocation assumptions to handle the bill cycle vs. accounting vs. PX end date.

Why dowe assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off? I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, thatwe should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well. Think about it, 25% is only 15% after tax. Has some one enumerated the risks and valued them on this deal? I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been done. I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goal line, return with little or no expense up front. I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a number of years? Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever? Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to look for a better deal? Jim: Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side? Why can't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense over the life of the deal? -----Original Message----- From: Waymire, Dave Sent:Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:17 AM To:Hayslett, Rod; Gilbert, Steve Cc:Centilli, James Subject:RE: Redfield Deliverability Project Rod, Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project. Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selectedwells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to their original levels. The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and are expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years. The cost to model and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM. A test program wouldbe conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of $768,000. If the test program did not prove out the project would be terminated at this point. The original proposal was totreat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment. This would result as Kent has indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years. As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage field. Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test results indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would spend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 years of the contract. NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfieldwell maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has committed $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to this project for a total of $1.5MM. Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing. Halliburton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the reason for high return requirement. The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with an Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other thirdparty at a more reasonable rate. Even at an estimated 30% return, preliminary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are between $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and $250,00 to $275,000 for the out years. -----Original Message----- From: Hayslett, Rod Sent:Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM To:Gilbert, Steve Cc:Waymire, Dave Subject:RE: Redfield Deliverability Project Couple of quick comments. Prepaying as an expense would require coming up with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense. An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up with the same accounting results as we do. What accountants have reviewed the proposal? -----Original Message----- From: Miller, Kent Sent:Thursday, October 11, 2001 9:52 AM To:Hayslett, Rod; McCarty, Danny Cc:Waymire, Dave; Neubauer, Dave; Neville, Sue; Thomas, Steve Subject:Redfield Deliverability Project Rod, We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long termproject that has negative short term cash flow. We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvements at Redfield through the use of improved technology related to identifying poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation. This project has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term standpoint. Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expected. Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and economics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30%). Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&Mexpenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 years of the project. We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expenses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been interested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure. What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these costs in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an Enron company that would finance/extend the expense payments. This is a great project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative earnings impacts in the first couple of years. Got any ideas to handle thisfinancial hurdle??????

        "content": "Excess OASDI Payments and Withholding Issue Sharon / Michelle / Kriste: The enclosed document addresses excess OASDI payment by Enron and excess OASDI withholdings from employees when U. S. domestic employee transfers occur between Enron BUs. The current situation results in significant Enron excess OASDI payment annually, and creates issues with employee due to overwithholding resulting in employee complaints and ill will towards HR, Payroll, and Enron. The document depicts apparent options, and a potential solution, to the current situation. This is viewed as an HR customer service issue to ensure Enron employees receive the best overall service possible in their interface to the HR function and systems. It is my understanding that Enron Executive Management feel that employee transferability among the BUs is important, and wishes to see more movement of employees (as well as thoughts and ideas) between the BUs in the future to enhance employee opportunities and Enron's value. This being the case, I would expect the Enron cost and employee impacts and issues to be acerbated as additional and increased employee movement occurs in the future. We need Legal review of the issues and opportunities as presented in the document to determine a solution to the current - and pending future - situation, and look forward to any guidance you can provide in resolving the problems the current situation creates for Enron employees who transfer between Enron entities within a tax year and to mitigate potential future issues. If there is not a Legal obstacle, we will then go to Tax to address the specific tax entity issues. Regards, Bob "

Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration. - The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework. - Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened awareness of RAC issues. \"De-silo-ization\" . - All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment. - Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams. - Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect. - Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will require more frequent informal meetings. - There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit, market risk or our portfolio. - All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to help out if needed. - If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen. - Encourage weak links in team to perform. - Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement. - If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor. - Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes. The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact. This process should begin immediately. Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort. Rick"

        "content": "Security and Human Rights Policy Question We are finishing the legal comments to the Security and Human Rights paper that Lauren Goldblatt circulated for legal review, and will finalize it today ot tomorrow. Before get the detailed comments out, however, there is a threshold policy issue that needs to be considered: These guidelines expressly applicaty to the \"Extractive Industries\", which are typically thought of as the mining and oil and gas exploration and development industries. The companies listed as cooperating with the UK and US governments and the NGO's in producing the principles do not include Enron peers. Enron has only one unit that is engaged in that economic sector, and that unit is being sold right now. None of Enron's other units are in what would normally be referred to as an extractive industry. Since that is the case, we wonder if Enron has made an appropriate level policy decision to publicly endorse these principles and make them corporate policy when the company is energetically exiting its only remaining business line that is in the express industrial peer group targeted by the principles? At first I understood that such a decision had been taken, but Vicki and I wanted to confirm that before proceeding. There are two major concerns: Endorsing the principles would would identify Enron more closely with the members of a particular peer group that Enron is consciously exiting and distingushing itself from. Once Enron endorses the principles, the fact of that endorsement, the resulting public \"accountability\" for the principles, and the consequent need to demonstrate compliance will become essentially a permanent feature. Once endorsed, it would be nearly impossible for the Company to distance itself from the guidlines. That being the case, should Enron at this juncture endorse the guidelines when it could do so later if it ever makes a committed re-entry into the extractive industry? Are there other security type principles that are more appropriate to or focused on our new core business lines, or the remaining asset ownership and construction lines that Enron should be looking at instead? Please call either me at 713-646-6309 to discuss. You can also call Vicki Sharp at 713-853-7413. Thanks. "

America West Airlines Inc., \"9th Cir., No. 99-17458, 8/8/01). Reversing summary judgment for America West Airlines and ordering summary judgment to plaintiff Penny Bachelder, the Ninth Circuit rules that the airline failed to inform its staff of the method it used to calculate the 12-month period in which employees are entitled to take 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where an employer fails to notify employees of its method for calculating leave eligibility, the method that is most beneficial to the plaintiff should be used, Judge Berzon writes. Applying a \"calendar method,\" the court determines that the leave that Bachelder took in 1996 was protected under the act. . . .

No. 103, 7/27/01 [released 8/1/01]). Overturning a decision by an administrative law judge, the majority finds that nurses who refused to volunteer for overtime work at the union's request and those who refused assigned overtime were engaged in a concerted refusal to work. The majority makes it clear that it is not suggesting that employees could not concertedly refuse to work voluntary overtime. Rather, it says, such a refusal must be preceded by the issuance of a 10-day notice if a union is responsible for the action. . . .

The board's decisions in \"M.B. Sturgis Inc.\" and \"Jeffboat Division, American Commercial Marine Service Co., \" involving temporary workers give rise to complicated bargaining situations, \"but I think collective bargaining is vibrant enough, if done in good faith, to achieve results,\" NLRB Chairman Hurtgen says. Part of the difficulty in situations involving temporary workers is created by the unions and employers themselves trying to decide whether including or excluding temps is to their side's advantage, he adds. Hurtgen says the board's unanimous ruling in \"Lee Lumber and Bldg. Material Corp.\" \"reflects a good result of board decisionmaking\" in which the board tried to fashion \"an easy-to-use rule\" in an area that involves \"unstable, difficult factual analysis.\" He speculates that future boards may fashion similar rules in other situations where good faith bargaining is ordered. When asked about a spate of recent D.C. Circuit decisions that have been rather critical of the board's decisionmaking, Member Liebman observes that any board member needs to develop either a thick skin or a sense of humor. \"I'm concerned by the disdain and contempt for board decisionmaking\" shown in certain appeals court rulings, Liebman adds. . . .

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Mexican officials at the State Department, Powell stresses that establishment of a new temporary worker program has to be \"done in a careful way, a way that will be seen as fair and equitable by ... the people of both nations.\" The group is looking to fashion a system that \"is grounded in reality and the needs of our economy, one that doesn't hurt U.S. workers,\" he says. The program \"will rest on a carefully worked-out partnership between the sending and receiving countries, one that recognizes also the contributions that undocumented Mexicans are making in the United States and that brings together willing\" workers and employers. A new guestworker program is one of a number of immigration reforms U.S. and Mexican officials have been discussing since President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox agreed last February to establish the working group. . . .

If PECO wants to continue to explore the transmission points, or other FERC policy points they no doubt will, but I don't think they go on the agenda, and certainly not first. I think it would be very important to attach current products definitions to the agenda, and would therefore plead with Liz and Marty to see if we can get those implemented and to Andy for distribution by Friday. Also, Mitch Dutton was the one with custody of the System Firm definition, and I will call him today to see if he can get it massaged and to Andy by Friday morning. I'd love to have a discussion, with traders present, about the bookout issue, but I don't know if we'll have time. The other \"global\" issue that the traders need to focus on (and will no doubt want an update on) is the status of the efforts to get FERC on board. Andy, can we at least give them tentatively that we WILL meet with FERC staff in January, and the tentative dates of the rollout sessions on the contract in Houston and New York? PD >>> <HEMU@dynegy.com> Tuesday, December 07, 1999 >>> Please take a look at this and give me your thoughts. One area that I believe needs more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; I think this is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they are concerned about. I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to the agenda. Do we have a definition of the \"Into __\" product that has been updated since the November 9 conference call? Is there a new defintion of the \"Firm (LD-System Reliability)\" product? What about trying to tackle bookouts if we have the time? Is there any conceivable way we will have the time?

Both of these events are good opportunities to \"test drive\" the Emerging Technologies program and see if there is an interest in joining our partner group. SEPTEMBER 8 - WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET? Our next insight-building event will be held at Wharton on Friday, September 8 and is entitled \"What Next On the Internet?\" This is primarily a Wharton faculty event and we will be exploring 3 areas: 1) the New Economics on the Web, 2) Internet, Anywhere, and 3) Implications for (academic) Research and Education. Speakers will include Jay Walker (Priceline.com), David Farber (Chief Technologist at the FCC) and Mohan Sawhney (Kellog Univ., one of the nation's thought leaders on e-Commerce), along with several senior Wharton faculty members. There will be considerable discussion on how the next generation of the Internet will evolve and the implications for management and management research. We are inviting our industry partners to join us at this event, and participate in the discussion, which should contain some valuable insights and also provides an opportunity to help set our research agenda. You are most welcome to participate, or designate a colleague, if you like. OCTOBER 19&20 - WINNERS & LOSERS IN THE E-COMMERCE SHAKEOUT This will be a major Impact Conference to explore the coming Internet shakeout, and apply some of the traditional shakeout measures to E-Commerce and try to determine what we can expect. It should be an intriguing day. If you plan to attend please RSVP early since we are sure to be \"overbooked\" for this event. This is probably the best showcase for our insight-building activities, if you would like to invite any colleagues help determine if it makes sense for Enron to become a partner in the ET Program. If you'd like to RSVP for you and any colleagues who would like to attend one or both of the events described above, send me an email reply and I'll send you a more detailed agenda and speaker description, etc. I'll be on vacation the rest of this week but if you have any questions or comments you can call or email me next week. best regards, Michael Michael S.

I believe that Enron should reconsider whether or not a Metgas selldown is a wise move at this time for the following reasons: 1. The Dabhol LNG terminal is ideally located for future LNG arbitrage plays, i.e., halfway between middle east and far east LNG suppliers. Opportunites for Mideast/Far East swaps or shipping backhauls could generate significant value for EGM. 2. Metgas currently holds exclusive rights to use Dabhol's LNG terminal for imports of LNG into India, and it will be at least several years (if ever) before a second LNG terminal is built in India. We should not be giving this strategic position away. 3. The fact that our competitors (e.g., Petronas, BP, BG etc.) want to buy in is an indicator that we have something of value. Even a partial selldown (and granting of voting rights) to one of these players could serously compromise our optionality and ability to maximize value to Enron. 4. I suspect that the market value of Metgas at this time (given that there is still significant developement risk) is fairly small relative to its network value to EGM. If, in spite of my arguments, a decison is made to sell down Metgas, there are two things that we could do to limit the damage: 1. Prior to the sale, sign an agreement between EGM and Metgas that provides EGM with exclusive rights to use the terminal, and 2. EGM should step into the Metgas/Malaysia LNG contract (i.e., EGM should buy from Malaysia and resell to Metgas) to ensure that we maintain maximum optionality in this contract. We could do this in a way that gives us control of the contract but passes Metgas risk through EGM and back to Malaysia. I understand that the time fuse for this selldown is very short---immediate action is needed if you want a vote on this. Rick "

Pacificorp advertises that each machine is capable of producing synfuel at the annual rate of 1.5 - 2.0 mm tons, for a total of 6 - 8 mm annual tons. We will meet with Pacificorp early next week in Portland to discuss a due diligence schedule and ground rules for the sale. We will obviously require one or more qualified monetizers to work with us on this deal from day one. If we line up more then one monetizer it would be helpful if we appoint a single monetizer to be the lead, otherwise we may end up facing conflicting demands from each monetizer. Our ideal structure would have the monetizers immediately owning 100% of the equity in the machines, while we provide the sites, coal supply, and synfuel sales. We need to work with the monetizers to identify qualified operators, while not taking any operating risk ourselves. Given the \"lease\" issue surrounding the Sempra deal, we need to make sure we structure Pacificorp (and AIG) as a mtm deal. We currently have a site team that has identified appropriate sites, and is starting the preliminary engineering and permitting work on each site. The sites include river terminals and mines in West Virginia and Kentucky. We expect to finalize Sempra this week ( 2 - machines on an accrual basis). \"Team Synfuel\" will then focus their activities on AIG (3 - machines) and Pacificorp (4 - machines) in order to close at least one of the deals by the end of October. Our goal remains to secure 4 - 6 machines by the end of the year. "

Beck Thomas E. Ganucheau BECK, REDDEN & SECREST, L.L.P. 1221 McKinney, Suite 4500 Houston, Texas 77010-2010 Laura Gibson ANSWERS TO INTERROGATORIES INTERROGATORY NO. 1: Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention that CPSC =01&breached the Assignment Agreement=018 by allegedly =01&failing to endeavor in good faith to obtain the consent from LCRA.=018 ANSWER: On July 30, 1999, Calpine entered into an agreement with Enron in which it agreed to assume Enron's obligation to supply power to the LCRA under the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 31, 1995 and as it was amended on April 15, 1999. The July 30, 1999 Assignment Agreement contains a condition that Calpine will obtain LCRA's written consent to the assignment and a release of Enron and its affiliates from any and all obligations and liabilities under the Agreement. Calpine specifically agreed to endeavor in good faith to obtain LCRA's consent as soon as practicable following Enron's execution of the Assignment Agreement. Shortly after the execution of the Assignment Agreement, Ed Baughman and Steve Snow spoke to determine the status of Calpine's efforts to obtain LCRA 's consent. Mr. Baughman followed up with Mr. Snow during the week of August 16, 1999 to determine the status of Calpine's efforts to obtain LCRA' s consent. It was clear from Mr. Baughman's conversation with Mr. Snow that Calpine was not exercising its best efforts to obtain LCRA's consent. When this became apparent, Mr. Baughman and others at Enron began making inquiries of LCRA to determine what would be required to obtain LCRA's consent. These conversations made it clear that Calpine had not explored the issue with the LCRA. Further, Enron representatives were advised by representatives of the LCRA that Calpine had not furnished any financial information to the LCRA to make it comfortable with Calpine's assumptionof the delivery obligations. Such failure by Calpine to use due diligence in obtaining LCRA's consent combined with its failure to provide the LCRA with any financial or credit information demonstrates that Calpine did not endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA's consent. INTERROGATORY NO. 2: Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention that CPSC failed =01&to exercise good faith in agreeing to reasonable requests relating to the assignment,=018 specifically identifying each and every alleged =01&reasonable request=018, and when, how, by whom, and under what circumstances the request was made, and CPSC's response to each request. ANSWER: Calpine failed to exercise good faith in agreeing to reasonable requests relating to the assignment by failing to endeavor in good faith to obtain LCRA's consent to the assignment, failing to provide LCRA with financial information and failing to provide LCRA with a parent guaranty guaranteeing Calpine Power Services Corporation's performance of its assumption of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement. Additionally, Calpine failed to agree to reasonable requests when it failed to provide an indemnification from its parent corporation indemnifying Enron in the event that Enron paid any money out on its guaranty to the LCRA. On or about August 26, 1999, after it became clear that Calpine was not taking any effort to endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA's consent, David Portz of Enron sent Ron Fischer of Calpine the documents necessary to provide Calpine's parent guaranty and indemnification of any payment by Enron under the LCRA agreement. Calpine refused to execute these documents or to negotiate in good faith for any necessary modifications thereto. Additionally, in a telephone conversation between Enron and Calpine representatives, Calpine conceded that in the past, it had traditionally provided a parent guaranty. INTERROGATORY NO. 3: Please describe in detail any and all damages allegedly suffered by you and for which you seek redress herein, and describe in detail the method by which such damages are calculated. ANSWER: Enron has not yet calculated the damages it has incurred as a result of Calpine's breach of its obligations under the Assignment Agreement. Enron continues to have an obligation to supply the LCRA with power and will be required to do so until the contract terminates on December 31, 2002. Enron will supplement this interrogatory in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. INTERROGATORY NO. 4: Do you contend that CPSC was obligated under the July 30, 1999 Letter to seek and/or secure a guarantee from Calpine Corporation? If you answer to either is =01&yes,=018 please describe in detail the legal and factual basis for each such contention. ANSWER: Yes. Beginning during approximately the summer of 1998, it became customary in the wholesale power market to provide a parent guarantee when the power was either being purchased by or sold to a marketing affiliate. In a telephone conference on the afternoon of August 27, 1999, Calpine representatives conceded that they generally provided a parent guaranty. Additionally, the representatives conceded that it did not cost Calpine Power Services Company any money to provide a parent guaranty. In the negotiations between Enron and Calpine prior to the execution of the Assignment Agreement, it was understood that Calpine would provide a parent guarantee. When the transaction changed from the back-to-back transaction to the assignment, in recognition of the increased risk, Enron increased the amount that it was willing to pay Calpine to assume its obligations under the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement to $1.8 million. In recognition that parent guarantees are customary in the industry, in December of 1999, Calpine and Enron exchanged parent guarantees. INTERROGATORY NO. 5: Identify each action which you contend is =01&customary and reasonable in the industry=018 and which you contend CPSC failed to undertake in order to =01&obtain LCRA's consent=018 to the assignment of the Power Agreement. ANSWER: Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable manner by failing to act promptly to obtain the LCRA's consent to Calpine's assignment. Further, Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable manner in failing to provide LCRA with any financial information concerning Calpine Power Services Corporation or its parent in order to assure the LCRA of Calpine's financial ability to perform under the Assignment Agreement. Calpine also failed to provide either Enron or LCRA with a parent guarantee and to provide parent indemnification to Enron for any amounts paid by Enron to the LCRA as a result of Calpine's failure to perform its obligations under the Power Purchase and Sale Agreement. INTERROGATORY NO. 6: Identify and describe in detail each and ever action taken by you to mitigate your alleged damages in this matter. ANSWER: On December 8, 1999, Enron gave notice to the LCRA of its termination of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 31, 1995, as amended on April 15, 1999 effective December 31, 2002. On December 31, 1999, Enron entered into an agreement with Oxy Vinyls, L.P. wherein Enron Power Marketing, Inc. purchased electrical capacity and energy from Oxy. Additionally, Enron has purchased the power necessary to supply the LCRA at the lowest prices available to it in the market.

December 1 Market Readiness Update Meeting Thane Twiggs (wholesale) and Nancy Hetrick (retail) will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues (or not) with their respective areas. We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers. I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting. If anyone hears anything else about the market delay, please let Jean Ryall know immediately. As of right now, it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled??? 2. Congestion Pass thru to EES' Retail Customers Thane Twiggs, Nancy Hetrick and Jim Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language. I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal. 3. Wholesale Issues (Thane Twiggs) a. Define workable TCR Product b. End Balanced Schedule requirement c. Fix Capacity Auction process, including credit matters d. BENA/OOM/AS e. Settlement & Billing 4. Retail Issues a. REP - ISO - Utility Interface (Nancy Hetrick) b. Reliant PTB (Pat Keene) c. TXU PTB (Pat Keene) d. Reliant Negative CTC (Pat Keene) e. TXU Negative CTC (Pat Keene) f. EES / EPMI License (Gloria Ogenyi + Nancy Hetrick) 5. Information Flow All policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with Jean Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity. Also, all people on the TO: list above should be included on all e-mail traffic. I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people, but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages. It is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest. By having Jean Ryall in the center, she will be able to ensure that no one feels \"cut out\". The bi-weekly meeting should be held with Jean Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner. 6. Wholesale Products Thane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market. Finally, it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for Enron in the Texas market. This is our \"home\" base - we need to make sure that our business efforts win big. Thanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result. Jim"

As well, I understand that there has been a number of communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business. I have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the larger dialogue. The Enron team has told me that TVA wishes to move to firm pricing and a MOU on this technology. Given the larger dialogue, I have suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are going.

The elusive Liz Miller failed to attend, having been called at the last minute into an all-day meeting. We have tentatively agreed that we will meet next week. Despite Liz Miller's absence, I believe that the meeting was productive. I learned the following information: 1. Doug Miller claims that there are three power grids that are unrelated, that he worked only in the East for ENA and works only in Texas for Calpine. Thus, he claims that his duties and activities do not overlap in any way with those he performed for ENA. 2. Calpine did not know of Miller's non-compete at the time Miller was hired because he believed it had expired. He brought it to Calpine's attention immediately upon being contacted by ENA. 3. Christina argued, as she did in the answer and counterclaim, that the non-compete agreement was fatally overbroad, as Miller never had any duties involving the majority of the activities from which the non-compete purports to bar him. In response, I told her the following: 1. We do not accept Miller's assertion that simply working in another region will sufficiently insulate our trade secrets, since strategies may not be confined to a single region. 2. I pointed out to her that Miller's contract very clearly states that the non-compete extends three months after employment even if the contract term has expired. I also pointed out that he was reminded of his non-compete orally several times by ENA personnel upon his resignation. 3. I explained that the non-compete had been enforced on many occasions and that it was carefully crafted with an eye to protecting the many trade secrets to which Miller may have had access. I argued that strategies concerning one aspect of ENA's business might impact many other areas and that, as such, the non-compete was not overly broad. [She asked what trade secrets we were trying to protect!! I, of course, declined to answer.] Despite the fact that I believe that these facts are clearly stated in our petition, she confessed to not having viewed the situation from the \"trade secret perspective.\" We ended the meeting with her stating that Calpine and Miller were both interested in trying to resolve the matter and that she welcomes a proposal from us. While she did not elaborate, I believe that they would entertain a suggestion of some sort of limitation on his activities for some short period of time. Please let me have your thoughts about this matter. Thanks. Best regards, Linda Broocks"

In review of the past two rate case settlements of Williston Basin (WBI) I found no such provisions. In its current rate case proceeding before FERC a limited settlement was reached which dealt primarily with net plant and labor costs. A hearing was held on all remaining issues and is currently in the briefing stage. Neither in the limited settlement, nor in the hearing was disposition of base gas revenues addressed. However, the reorganizational settlement that conveyed facilities from MDU to WBI may be a factor. As a result of restructuring under 636 WBI was obligated to sell certain excess volumes of company owned working gas (priced at $.47 /mcf) to its customers. WBI proposed to sell the gas at market andretain any profits. As mentioned in the LeBeoeuf, Lamb memo the Commission addressed this issues several times, reversing itself in the process, andfinally ordered that WBI must sell the working gas at cost. Though not relying entirely on the reorganizational settlement, throughout the various orders, the Commission referenced the 1985 reorganizational settlement as requiring any gains on the sale of working gas to be flowed through to WBI customers. WBI sought rehearing, arguing that the Commission was taking a very broad interpretation of the settlement. The Commission raised the issueagain in its order on rehearing, among other things, and WBI didn't seek rehearing or pursue that particular argument further, which the Commission points out in its final order. As LeBeoeuf Lamb asserts, the environment (Order 636 restructuring) in which the Commission ordered flow-through of profits on the sale of storage volumes has changed and those arguments may not be applicable anymore. But, the reorganizational settlement might be something to take into account and should be discussed with WBI. Just something to be aware of. If you have any questions please call.

So far, I am planning to make the following non-substantive changes: 1. The table of contents was seriously messed up by an \"automatic update\" feature in Word just before we duplicated and filed. I will be putting it back to the state you saw in the final draft. 2. On p.7, section 1.12, put a period at the end of the last sentence. 3. On p.9, section 1.1.3.1, two thirds of the way down the page, I will be changing \"subject to adjustment annual by the base rate PBR formula\" to \"subject to adjustment annually by the base rate PBR formula\". 4. On p.27, section 1.5.4, in the third full paragraph on the page, I will be changing \"If only one customer has an OFO day\" to \"If only one customer class has an OFO day\". 5. Also on p.27, section 1.5.4, bottom line on the page, I will be filling in the blank with \"C\" (so it reads \"Appendix C\") In the category of \"maybe substantive\", 1. On p.10, section 1.1.3.2, three lines from the bottom of the page, the date \"October 1, 2000\" would be changed to \"October 1, 2001\". This sentence refers to including the cost of backbone transmission for core customers buying gas from SoCalGas in the \"procurement\" rate. Obviously, our intent was to do that only once we had unbundled backbone transmission, which happens on October 1, 2001. In the category of \"substantive\": 1. Our capacity term sheet had said that we would unbundled \"additional\" (non-reliability) storage for CTAs effective upon implementation of the settlement (See p.4). The filed settlement managed to drop the section that provided for this option for CTAs prior to the principal storage change on April 1, 2001. (The filed settlement is ok for the period starting April 1, 2001). So, to be consistent with the term sheet, we need to insert something back into the settlement to allow CTAs to opt out of non-reliability storage in the period from the effective date (90 days after approval) to April 1, 2001. Obviously, this may not be a very long period. John Leslie has suggested inserting at the very beginning of Section 5.4.4.3: \"In the partial storage year beginning on the effective date of this Settlement Agreement, and....[continue with current text].\" We would need to cover as part of implementation filings the exact mechanism/pricing for SoCalGas purchasing gas in storage owned by CTAs if they opt out of nonreliability storage prior to April 1. 2001. SoCalGas and SDG&E are ok with John's language and want to make sure it is ok with other signatories. If you have any problems with any of these changes, please contact me or Brian Cherry by noon on Friday, April 28. My email is gsullivan@sempra.com and my phone is (619) 699-5162. Brian's email is bcherry@sempra.com and phone is (213) 244-3895.

You also may recall that we briefly discussed the potential for legal/accounting/other issues that may arise as a result of any such amendment. So that the Whitewing process can be moved forward, would you please consider the following: 1. Have any legal/accounting/other issues been identified as resulting from an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement? 2. If so, what are the potential solutions to any such issues? 3. Have definite conclusions been reached regarding the economics of ENA's preferred return on the Whitewing interest, such that a draft of the necessary partnership allocations can be undertaken? 4. Has a decision been made regarding who will be charged with drafting the amendments? Will it be the Margaux legal team? The Houston Global Finance legal group? Other??

I met with all the OSS Directors and gave them the following attached guidelines and an opportunity to redesign the organzation, without filling back Larry's position. The org charts below represent the organization that we have agreed to pursue. I have met with Laura and Brian to review the organization and to have compensation review. Gary Smith has reviewed the proposal and given his approval. While we will encounter a couple of moves, in order to implement this, we will keep the staffing levels whole and reduce by one (1) directors position, and not increase our current estimate. The real benefits to this organization are: It provides better supervision and alignment with the field operations. It will provide for better training opportunities for future management positions. It will better align our consolidation efforts. It will off-load some daily supervisory responsibilities from David, Elaine and Barney. It will free up some time for David, Elaine and Barney to better oversee and improve the quality of the financial data.

Please do not forward this e-mail to other parties. During a meeting with Comm. Bilas today, he confirmed what we had been previously advised, namely: He did not communicate with any of his colleagues regarding the PD, he is very disappointed at the limited scope of the PD, and knows it does not go as far as it should; he would support an alternate offered by another commission which adopted more or all of the CSA. He strongly urges parties to take their concerns about the PD to the other commissioners. He acknowledges it will be a tough sell. However, he does not have any communication from the Democratic commissioners on this issue either way, so he cannot predict their reaction with any certainty. The main reason for his issuance of the PD in this form appears to be that he felt that a more aggressive PD issued by a Wilson appointee would attract attacks simply because it was not offered by the new commissioner. Additional data points: Other key CPUC staff with access to President Lynch that I spoke with today urged us to meet with her, and to emphasize that the CSA does not result in a reduction in CPUC jurisdiction or regulatory control (like AB 1890 did) and to take our best shot at convincing her and Comm. Wood that customers, including core customers, may far much worse under the interim than under the CSA (particularly in view of the interstate capacity issues--as described by Mark Pocta of ORA on our recent conf. call). In addition, a fourth Commissioner (who will be around to vote next year) suggested similar tactics and offered support for such an effort. In light of this information, I suggest that we proceed to issue the letter as planned, and ask that all parties, including SoCalGas, quickly review the next draft to see if they can sign on. We would like to have as many of the CSA signatories as possible on the letter. I hope to get the new draft out today or early tomorrow. Please respond by COB Thursday or early on Friday. Next, I have asked for a meeting with Pres. Lynch. I would like other parties to attend as well (or schedule their own meetings). As soon as I get a date, I will advise. Bottom line: We urge parties to sign the letter and to file comments supporting adoption of the CSA. We need to meet with Lynch, and until and unless we get a firm \"no\", we should not assume the settlement is dead. We should file comments on the PD on Monday which at least list our objections to the PD and open the door for discussions on how to revive the CSA. If possible, we will try to arrange a conference call on Friday. Please call if you have any questions. Mike Day"

Unfortunately, many of you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your staff's salary is. I have the average salary for each of the different staffing levels.

To much movement of people. So using estimates and averages will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels. Here's what you can do: 1) Make a list of your staff just their positions. 2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to average, etc. You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that position, etc. 3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget. 4) Here is the average: Sr. $4,961 Spec $3,964 Staff $3,026 Sr. Clrk $2,548 Clerk $2,264 Asst $3,162 Your list would look something like this: Assistant Average Clerk Very High Sr. Clerk Low Specialist Low to Average Specialist Average Sr. Specialist Average to High Analyst (They are all allocated at the same amount) You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them. It's up to you. Next Item - TRAINING!!!

The documents are marked against the original Hawaii 125-0 facility entered into in March of this year. Please note that it is the intention of Enron to roll over all of the tranches in the current Hawaii facility into this two year facility on the closing date. Accordingly, we have utilized the existing trust and merely amended and restated the trust agreement (renaming the trust Hawaii II 125-0).

Thanks, Lisa -----Original Message----- From: Schroeder, Mark Sent:Thursday, October 18, 2001 3:50 PM To:Yoho, Lisa Cc:Pack Jr., Scott Subject:restrictive contract clauses Lisa - as you probably know, the Pitt seam is characterised by a few dominant players, most notably Consol and RAG. Consol, especially, is resistant to our business model (transparency, liquidity). We have heard that they are putting clauses into contracts that prohibit the resale of their coal, by their utility customers. I used to know more about this area of the law,but isn't this impermissible? If so, (but don't do this, yet), is it possible to give DOJ a \"heads up\", so they could send appropriate demands for information? We definitely would not want our fingerprints on this. Policymakers should be on our side, as a matter of energy policy, because in times like these, when coal supplies are still tight, you want free movement ofthe commodity to where it is needed, when it is needed, rather than creating artificial shortages because someone long Pitt seam coal cannot re-sell it. Also, such restrictions are likely to inhibit development of effectiverisk management mechanisms, like the Northerern App. contract that Allegheny has been talking about (and which I understand we might put on EOL, if/when the contract is developed). Your thoughts? thanks mcs "

The contract is a 3-year VBN deal covering certain i2 locations in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and India. The TCV of the deal is $14.8 million. This is one of the first major external VBN deals for Enron and has been instrumental in shaping the VBN offering. It also brings an anchor network client to our Tokyo and India sites. The interactions with i2 on this agreement have also contributed to our understanding of which BOS features are most desired by customers. The i2 deal is the result of a lot of hard work and persistence by a number of folks throughout EBS and other Enron groups. Just about everyone in EBS' Technology Channels Group contributed to the i2/Enron relationship that culminated in the network deal. Particular thanks to Mike Haney who led the team through multiple iterations of the deal structure. Special thanks to David Berberian, Erin Wesling, and Brad Harris who spent lots of time on the contract and the network design work with i2. Thanks also to LaRence Snowden, Tony Gilmore, and Beaven Fernandez of TDS, Steve McCarrel of Legal, Wayne Gardner of Tax, and Laura Leibman of Regulatory who helped throughout the course of the deal structuring and to Everett Plante, Larry Ciscon, and Kenny Burroughs and their teams who provided input on BOS and network topics. In addition, thanks to the Enron India team who supported the deal throughout the design and negotiation process. i2 has remarked often on the professionalism and collaborative spirit of the Enron team throughout this process. Enron is now i2's preferred network provider, and we are poised to provide the rest of i2's data network worldwide as soon as the design specifications are completed by i2. Thanks again to the entire team on your success. Best regards. -- Rex "

        "content": " sshackle.nsf I hate to sound like a jerk (but its the nature of my job, and perhaps my personality, so I will). Another day has passed and the Bank has yet to see paper, and frankly we have yet to see the Bank's paper. Frankly I am very concerned about this getting done on time. I know this can all be put in place, but I think we need to make a concerted and coordinated effort to make this our individual priorities between now and Friday. I will be in a plane until mid-afternoon tomorrow, but will be reachable after that by cell @ 403-819-5528. In my absence Greg Johnston has kindly agreed to help out. Greg can be reached @ 403-974-6745. I want to set out below the various tasks and responsibilities as I see them, and the outstanding issues as I understand them. I think a distribution of all drafts needs to be circulated by no later than mid-afternoon tomorrow, with a view to review of drafts Tuesday, revising drafts Wednesday, finalizing drafts and executing Thursday and funding Friday. A. SWAP #1 w/ Swapco (Bow River Trust): * Credit worksheet - Bill * ISDA Master, etc. - Tana/Sara * Transaction terms (gas prepay) - Brian/Soma/RBC * Confirm (gas prepay) - Sara * Blakes opinion re; ECC - Warren * Enron Corp. G'ee - Clement * J. Derrick opinion re: Enron Corp. - Clement * VE opinion re: Enron Corp. - ? (Clement) * Macleod Dixon opinion re: Swapco - Warren to follow-up B. SWAP #3 w/ RBC * Credit worksheet - Bill * ISDA Master, etc. - Tana/Sara * Transaction terms (gas swap) - Brian/Soma/RBC * Confirm (gas swap) - Sara * Transaction terms (interest rate swap) - Brian/Soma/RBC * Confirm (interest rate swap) - Sara * Blakes opinion re; ECC - Warren * Enron Corp. G'ee - Clement * J. Derrick opinion re: Enron Corp. - Clement * VE opinion re: Enron Corp. - ? (Clement) * Macleod Dixon opinion re: RBC - Warren to follow-up C. OTHER * Fee Letter - Macleod Dixon - Warren to follow-up * Indemnification re: Increased Costs - Macleod Dixon - Warren to follow-up * Promissory Note from ECPC to ECC - Greg * Resolution re: Promissory Note for ECC - Greg * Resolution re: Promissory Note for ECPC - Greg D. ISSUES * Generic cross-default to any ECC swap in ECC portfolio over specified threshold amount - as discussed, I would consider this as unacceptable but will defer to commercial. The scope of the default would be overly broad, the Bank is relying on Enron Corp. credit and will have a third party debt x-default to Enron Corp. of US$100MM. If agreed, this needs to be considered for both Swap #1 and #3 * Cross-default to Enron Corp. Credit Agreement - as discussed, this should be unnecessary if Credit Agreement reps/wars/covenants are in the Enron Corp. G'ee, but this could be a solution to providing a short for Enron Corp. G'ee * Cross-default to Swapco Credit Agreement with BF Equity for illegality - as discussed, since ECC is not a party to that transaction and would have no standing to take any position to prevent acceleration, since ECC would nonetheless be obligated on Swap #1, the Bank's only issue would be timing of repayment, the risk is more theoretical than real for the Bank and given that the loan is part of the Bank's own off-balance sheet structure, this should not be acceptable. If agreed, this needs to be considered for both Swap #1 and #3 * Syndication - the Bank will be entitled to syndicate up to 50% of the amount funded under Swap #1 to Canadian Chartered Banks, but not more than 20% of the funded amount to Schedule II Canadian Chartered Banks. Increased cost of funding by Schedule II Banks will be accounted for under the interest rate swap. The issue will be to define the parameters of our participation in syndication, to whom we have recourse under Swap #3 (and #1) and to document the right to syndicate Swap #1 separately from the adjustment to the interest rate swap. Finally, we need some answers on my earlier e-mail, including as to wiring of funds and amount required to be funded. PK "

As I mentioned, I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with Air Products and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have read about Enron. Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends who might be kind enough to \"keep their eyes open\" and share thoughts and ideas as to companies I should contact. I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume. As you can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strong operations background. I would certainly enjoy another position as an Operations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well. I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range of industries. Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would be very encouraging. I am open to any avenues you suggest. Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances. It seems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few select introductions. Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or who can direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated. The more contacts I make, the more opportunities I can uncover. If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down. I will contact you again in a few weeks to discuss your ideas. Thank you in advance for your help.

Please see Section 6 in particular. Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and Texas law will apply. We could move that to New York, with New York law if that is better for Henwood. If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K. law, with arb in Singapore. but any other law, including Australian law, would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please). I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwood's proposal, and believe I succeeded. Our form has some additional terms not contained in their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the \"Business Conduct\" and \"Drug Policy\" language).

Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost plus 15%--so you might not want to do it. Please let me know if you have any comments or questions. Bonnie "

According to Emily, there is no group effort that exists (i.e., a telecom committee or an individual AG taking the lead on telecom issues). Individual AGs get involved, but that is all. For example, MA AG Tom Reilley recently opposed Verizon's application for 271 authority, but the FCC still granted Verizon's petition. Emily recommends that we use the AGs as much as possible. For example, if we believe that local competition is non-existent and we have evidence to that effect, we should certainly convey that information to the individual AG and have him/her weigh in on our behalf. Emily recognizes that Enron is pro-competitive and that typically the AGs would be in agreement with our positions - so it's something for us to keep in mind as we move forward. There's no guarantee that the FCC will listen to the AGs, but it may be worth a try. If anyone has any thoughts or comments, please let me know. Thanks. Lara"

We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue. Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis. Costs would be shared proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to a specific operating group. I believe we need this inventory. If we try to enforce our non-competition agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.

As discussed below, we do not believe that there is any adverse interest between Enron and these two companies, but Liz wanted you to be comfortable with her concurrent representation of these two other defendants. (As I may have mentioned before, many of the defendants in the joint defense group are represented by one law firm. There is a commonality of interest in the defenses to the Trust's claims.) The complaint against Arizona Public consists only of preference claims in the amount of $300,000 and an objection to its $420,000 proof of claim. Griffin Energy has been sued for breach of contract, turnover, unjust enrichment, fraudulent transfer, etc. Total amount of claims equal $530,000. With Griffin, PCA failed to deliver power in May and the Griffin terminated its contract with PCA before the energy spikes began to occur. Liz has review the complaint against Enron and our draft answer and is aware of our issues and defenses. None of our defenses would be in conflict with the defenses asserted by Arizona Power or Griffin. If fact, many of the same defenses would be raised. Both Arizona Public and Griffin would agree that if any sort of issue conflict came up in the future or if Enron became otherwise uncomfortable with the concurrent representations, Liz would withdraw from representing Arizona Power and Griffin and they will waive any right to assert a conflict or seek disqualification. Assuming that Arizona Public and Griffin Energy are not otherwise adverse to Enron in other matters (which Liz did not believe they were), are you comfortable with these concurrent representations? I believe that there may be some beneficial economies in the concurrent representations in that Liz's time at hearings involving all defendants, etc. would be split among the defendants. However, if you're uncomfortable, then that's the end of the analysis. Liz is waiting to get back to Arizona Public and Griffin, so once you've decided, please let me know.

        "content": "Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ISDA Hi Carol, Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited (\"WCL\") in order to replace the existing securities representations (as found near the bottom of this e-mail) in the ISDA to: \"It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives.\" From my perspective, there are four main reasons why this amendment would not be appropriate. They are as follows: 1. Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives (\"91-504\") and the corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted. At this time, 91-504 is merely a proposal. In addition to checking the Ontario Securities Commission (\"OSC\") website, I have contacted the lawyer who first brought the \"securities representation\" issue to our attention and he has confirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have been no recent announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such adoption. 2. Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto, any trade with Enron Canada Corp. (\"Enron Canada\") is likely to be considered a \"trade within Alberta\" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta). As a result, it is important that we get representations which address Alberta securities law. 3. In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a \"trade\" can take place in a number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. Although it may seem unlikely, it is possible that trades could possibly be made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario. With the exception of British Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting similar \"blanket orders\", \"policies\" or \"rules\" with respect to this issue. However, it is usually Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at the forefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining jurisdictions eventually following the leaders). I expect that, once 91-504 is in place, we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. Regardless, it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbia in place at this time. 4. I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge the fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an \"OTC Derivative\" (and thus, have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions potentially available to them). I can think of no reason why it would be beneficial to either party to remove this representation. With respect to our physical agreements, we have addressed points 1, 2 and 3 above (as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are provided by blanket orders and policies {as opposed to the Securities Act (Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} and are, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the following clause: \"(i) each Transaction shall constitute a =01&commodity contract=018 or an =01&OTC derivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securities legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction, and (ii) it is a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted from time to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction;\" I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to the \"open-ended\" nature of the above-mentioned clause. If we want to refer to 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place, I would suggest that we amend the existing clause, which states: Canadian Securities Acts. (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an =01&OTC Derivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securities Act (British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it is a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc#394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC), as in effect on the date hereof. to: Canadian Securities Legislation. (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an \"OTC derivative\" within the meaning of paragraph 4 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc#394043 (\"ASC 394043\"), paragraph 1.1 of British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC) (\"BCSC 91-501\") and/or paragraph 1.1 of [proposed] Ontario Securities Commission Rule 91-504 =01) Over-The-Counter Derivatives [as published by the Ontario Securities Commission on January 7, 2000] (\"[Proposed] OSC 91-504\"), as applicable to such Transaction, (ii) it is a \"Qualified Party\" within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of ASC 394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of BCSC 91-501, as in effect on the date hereof, and (iii) it is a \"qualified party\" within the meaning of paragraph 1.1 of [Proposed] OSC 91-504. Once 91-504 is formally adopted by the OSC, the bold and square bracketed language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which were drafted using such language. Similarly, if there are amendments to the Alberta or British Columbia orders or a province (other than Ontario, Alberta or British Columbia) which could possibly have/claim some jurisdiction with respect to a transaction under the ISDA issues a similar order or policy, you may want to amend the clause (and possibly, the pre-existing ISDAs). I hope this discussion is useful for you. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call. I can be reached directly at (403) 974-6708. Mark."

AOL has fought aggressively over the past year in Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and with local governments to force AT&T to open its high-speed cable network to competitors. ?????\"It's one of the monster issues,\" said Whyman, who is a principal at Legg Mason's Precursor Group. AOL CEO Steve Case \"said they're committed to consumer choice. What we don't know is whether other ISPs besides AOL will have nondiscriminatory access to Time Warner networks.\" ?????Whyman said the merger will likely turn the Internet into a video vehicle quicker than initially expected, which will ultimately put pressure on telephone companies to speed up their deployment of high speed digital subscriber lines (DSL). ?????Barbara Dooley, executive director of the Commercial Internet eXchange Association, said the merger proves that the marketplace is working, and that it's too early to determine which way broadband will grow. She added that smaller ISPs are still in a position to make deals with other broadband providers. ?????\"There will be other alternatives to cable,\" she said. \"An ISP in a particular area will not have to offer all options.\" ?????On the cable side, AT&T, a frequent sparring partner with AOL over broadband issues, said the merger reconfirms the importance of cable broadband. ?????\"The proposed deal underscores the significance of broadband distribution and it reconfirms the value of AT&T's considerable broadband assets,\" a spokeswoman said. ?????And National Cable Television Association President and CEO Robert Sachs boasted in a statement that the deal proves that cable is the future of high-speed Internet service and that regulators have been wise to stay out of the broadband fight to date. ?????The Baby Bells remained adamant in their argument that they need regulatory relief to compete with the new mega companies like AT&T and now AOL. ?????\"This new mega-company would be providing cable, Internet and telephony virtually regulation free,\" said David Bolger, spokesman for the United States Telecom Association, which represents the Bells. \"We have the shackles and they don't.\" ?????The merger must pass muster with the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC had no comment on the AOL-Time Warner announcement. ?- by Rebecca S. Weiner ?AntitrustAntitrust Anticipation Follows Merger Announcement ?????Opponents of the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner raised antitrust concerns Monday about the monopolization of the market for high-speed Internet access and consolidation of content on the Web. ?????But proponents of the merger said the announcement underscored the marketplace ability's to resolve competitive concerns, and noted a combined AOL-Time Warner would present a potent new competitor to Microsoft and to AT&T. ?????\"Consumers do not want to be beholden to a giant media-Internet dictatorship, even if it promises to be a benevolent one,\" said Andy Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, which issued a joint statement with Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, and the Center for Media Education expressing strong reservations about what would be the biggest corporate merger in U.S. history. ?????The groups are calling for the Federal Communications Commission to require cable and other high-speed Internet access providers to open their networks to competitors and asking that AT&T's ownership interests in Time Warner are severed. ?????But others dismissed those arguments, noting that \"over the past two years, we have this phenomenon whereby a new merger or technology is announced and some company is immediately put forward as the media giant,\" said James Gattuso, vice president for policy and management at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, citing a string of prognostications about SBC, BellAtlantic, Microsoft, AT&T, and now AOL-Time Warner. ?????If consummated, the merger is also likely to benefit Microsoft's defense against the Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit, said William Kovacic, an antitrust law expert at George Washington University Law School. \"The fact that the industry environment is extremely turbulent and unpredictable and can change the position of companies in a real hurry makes it hard to prescribe remedies that won't go into affect for two-and-a-half years.\" ?????A spokesman for Microsoft said the company had no comment on the merger. ?????Kovacic also said he anticipated a free-for-all among regulatory agencies seeking jurisdiction to review the proposed merger, including the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the FCC, state attorneys general, municipalities, public service regulatory bodies and foreign governments. ?????The merger's critics are particularly concerned that AOL will reverse its long-standing argument to force broadband networks open. ?????\"I think [AOL CEO] Steve Case is the Benedict Arnold of the digital age,\" said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education. \"To me, what I heard today was a reversal of their public position,\" said Chester. ?- by Drew Clark ?On The Hill Lawmaker Calls For Antitrust Hearings ?????Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman Mike DeWine, R-OH, said Monday that the Judiciary Committee intends to hold hearings to scrutinize the proposed America Online-Time Warner merger. ?????\"It seems that this deal could make sense for consumers by creating an organization that will deliver news and information more efficiently across the video/broadband spectrum,\" DeWine said in a statement. ?????\"However, whenever a dominant Internet company merges with a leading media conglomerate, it raises a whole host of competition and public policy issues,\" DeWine said. \"One concern in particular is the impact this may have on the so-called 'marketplace of ideas.' We need to examine the many implications of this deal.\" ?????\"This merger also adds a new wrinkle to the broadband 'open-access' debate by potentially resolving it through private negotiation rather than by government regulation,\" DeWine concluded. ?????In a statement released Monday, Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Patrick Leahy, D-VT, expressed more skepticism. \"We will have to look closely at whether it makes public policy sense to consolidate control of content, cable and Internet service distribution channels,\" he said. \"At some point, all of this concentration and convergence has implications for consumers because it will minimize competition and choice, giving us fewer voices and fewer pipelines in the marketplace.\" ?????Although Leahy said, \"this merger between one of the largest owners of content with the largest provider of Internet services may have been inevitable,\" he added, \"an element of caution is only prudent given the scope and impact of this planned merger.\" ?????\"The great promise of the Internet has been to allow people a wide range of information sources and choices,\" said Leahy. \"What we should do is make sure that all that information does not become funneled and controlled by just two or three sources.\" ?????A spokesman for Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-AZ, said he had no comment about the proposed merger.

Chair Hebert announed that J. Mark Robinson will head the Office of Energy Projects replacing Dan Adamson. Mark has served as OEP director of Environmental/Engineering Review since 1999. He joined FERC in 1978 and has held various posts since then. Robert Cupina is to serve as Deputy Director, having most recently served as Director of the Division of Rates/Tariffs Central.

What is interesting here is that the Chief ALJ is requesting guidance from the Commission to determine whether there should be a more complete record regarding any possibility of affilate standards. The case is far more complex than originally anticipated in the March 28 order (with 17 days of hearings, three linear feet of exhibits and 2,700 pages thus far in testimony. Six rebuttal witnesses remain to be heard from and it is anticipated the hearing will continue all next week)Due to the complexity, Chief ALJ Wagner recommends that the parties be given thirty days from June 8, 2001 (July 9) for filing proposed findings of fact and initial briefs. Further, the reply briefs should be filed no later than July 24, 2001. The ALJ on the case will issue the initial decision within 30 days after reply briefs are filed. It is requested that the Commission waive the initial decision date in this case. http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/GAS/RP/RP00-241.00W.TXT"

Version 1.4 include the standards for implementing Internet web sites (which pipelines were already required to implement on June 1, 2000); critical notices, and multi-tier allocations. Pipelines are required to make filings to incorporate these standards into their tariffs not less than 30 days prior to May 1, 2001. Order 587-M also discusses the fact that GISB was unable to adopt consensus standards for cross-contract ranking. Pipelines were willing to move to a process of confirming on an entity to entity basis, but the LDCs and producers also wanted to require pipelines to provide detailed confirmation data to working interest owners and downstream parties. The Commission determined that it did not have sufficient information to rule on this issue. Accordingly, the Commission directed staff to convene a technical conference to discuss cross-contract ranking. "

The Minister signed a regulation under the Electric Utilities Act that excludes imports from influencing the determination of the pool price. The Power Pool has been tasked to work out the mechanics of implementing the regulation. Larry Charach advised that this move was made by the politicians in the face of advice not to do it from Larry. Apparently the Premier met with representatives of Alberta farmers yesterday and also learned of what the Government considers to be excessive pricing being offered by Enmax (the City of Calgary owned retailer) that included: 1 Year (on-peak) $190/Mwh Cdn, 1 Year (all-hours) $137/Mwh Cdn. Peter Keohane and I have a meeting tomorrow morning with lawyers from Blakes. The present thinking is that we need to get legal advice on whether we need to send a letter to the Government indicating that Enron believes this action to be contrary to the provisions of the EUA prior to our participating in the MAP Auction on Monday and Tuesday. The fear is that our conduct of pursuing new commercial opportunities in this market may somehow estop us from later arguing the new regulation is ultra vires the EUA. Notwithstanding the advice we get on this point, there is agreement here (Milnthorp and Keohane) that if we do send a letter it must not include a paragraph threatening to sue the Alberta Government.

The attorney representing the FCC bore the brunt of the judges' frustrations and, at times, caustic comments on that issue. But on the legal issues, the lawyer representing the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc., in its challenge to an FCC decision seemed to take the harder hits. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington must decide whether the FCC acted \"arbitrarily and capriciously\" in prescribing a 6.5% increase in \"average schedule\" universal service support. \"Average schedule\" companies use formulas derived by NECA and approved by the FCC to approximate their per-loop costs of providing service. This is in contrast to so-called \"cost companies,\" which perform studies to calculate their actual per-loop costs. The case marks the first time that NECA, which the FCC has charged with updating the formula used by \"average schedule\" companies to calculate universal service support, has asked the court to review an FCC order, NECA attorney Richard A. Askoff pointed out during oral arguments this morning. The judges spent as much time seeking information on how the \"average schedule\" mechanism works as they did questioning attorneys about their legal arguments. Judge David S. Tatel asked for clarification of how the \"average schedule\" formula was applied to individual companies. After FCC attorney Laurel Bergold spent nearly all her allotted time in an unsuccessful attempt to clarify that aspect of the case, Chief Judge Harry T. Edwards commented, \"We get hard things from the FCC, but this [case] is bizarre.\" Mr. Askoff apparently cleared up the matter for the judges during his rebuttal arguments. He explained that certain data (such as the number of loops per exchange) is plugged into the \"average schedule\" formula to determine a given carrier's amount of support. But Mr. Askoff faced some tough questions from Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg regarding NECA's argument that it hadn't received proper notice of the FCC's intention to prescribe the 6.5% adjustment. Judge Ginsburg wondered what NECA would have said to the FCC, if it had received notice, that it didn't say in advocating a 33% increase in universal service support for \"average schedule\" carriers. Mr. Askoff said NECA would have discussed the \"fallacy\" of the FCC's belief that universal service support should be tied to growth in the number of local loops. Judge Edwards replied that NECA already had made that argument before the FCC. The case (\"National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc., v. FCC,\" no. 00- 1055) stems from an FCC decision to reject NECA's proposed \"average schedule\" universal service formula for 1998-1999. ******************************************************* CLECs WANT RECORD ON PACIFIC BELL InterLATA SERVICE BID `REFRESHED' The California Office of Ratepayer Advocates, several trade associations representing competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), and nine individual CLECs have asked the state Public Utilities Commission to \"refresh\" its record on Pacific Bell's compliance with federally mandated market-opening standards before deciding whether the telco has met those standards. In a joint petition filed Friday, Feb. 2, they argued that the record in the proceeding was \"too stale\" for the commission to reach credible conclusions about Pacific Bell's compliance with the market-opening mandates by May 24--the date the commission is scheduled to issue a final decision. Compliance with a 14-point competitive \"checklist\" of market-opening moves outlined in section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 is a prerequisite to Bell companies' receiving FCC authorization to provide in-region interLATA (local access and transport area) service. The FCC is required to consult with relevant state commissions and the Justice Department before ruling on a Bell company's section 271 application. Bell companies typically try to convince the state regulators of their compliance before submitting an application to the FCC. The joint petitioners told the California commission that the record in the proceeding could be supplemented \"in a relatively prompt and efficient manner.\" If \"Pacific Bell intends to include updated or other additional information in its application to be filed with the FCC, then it should make thatinformation available to the [California commission] and the parties to this proceeding now,\" the petitioners said. Such action would be \"consistent with the FCC's goal that the state commission be the principal forum for resolving factual disputes in the first instance, rather than require the [California commission] and the parties to address Pacific Bell's showing for the first time after being thrust into an expedited review process before the federal agency in Washington, D.C.\" In addition to the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, the joint petitioners were the California Association of Competitive Telecommunications Companies, the Association of Communications Enterprises, the Competitive Telecommunications Association, AT&T Communications of California, Inc., WorldCom, Inc., Advanced Telcom, Inc., XO California, Inc., Spring Communications Co. LP, New Edge Network, Inc., ICG Telecom Group, Inc., Rhythms Links, Inc., and Time Warner Telecom of California, Inc. ******************************************************* CONSUMER GROUPS CALL FOR `PRO-COMPETITIVE' FCC ACTION The Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union today issued a report stating that policy-makers have failed in their attempt to expand consumer choice in local and broadband services. In \"Lessons from the 1996 Telecommunications Act,\" the groups called for increased regulation of large companies that \"continue to monopolize the cable TV and local telephone industries.\" The report said the Act's failure stems from the fact that the major providers of cable TV and local phone service have chosen to merge rather than compete. \"Most of the local phone service market still belongs to the regional Bell monopolies, which, thanks to a series of mergers, have shrunk from seven companies in 1996 into just four today,\" the groups said. The report asked lawmakers to promote \"meaningful competition\" among local service providers by pressing for adoption of certain market-opening principles nationwide. It specifically cites local market-opening moves in New York and Texas. In the broadband services market, a handful of dominant companies have refused to enter each other's markets, agreeing instead to merge and swap assets, the report says. \"Cable monopolies have saddled consumers with huge rate increases and sought to impose their closed business model on the broadband Internet by making it nearly impossible for outside companies to offer Internet services over the monopolies' cable lines,\" the groups stated. They asked lawmakers to put an end to \"abusive\" cable TV pricing practices, require telcos to provide nondiscriminatory access to their high-speed networks, enforce media ownership limits that promote diversity, and block further consolidation that undermines potential competition. ******************************************************* MOBILE PHONE INDUSTRY FACES LATEST HEALTH-RELATED LAWSUIT The wireless phone industry is facing another lawsuit, this one filed on behalf of a 38-year-old Georgia man who says his cellphone caused his brain tumor. It's the latest in a growing number of such lawsuits alleging that the industry manufactured and marketed the devices despite knowing their potential adverse health effects. The lawsuit, \"Brian Lane Barrett and Diana Barrett v. Nokia Corp. et al.\" (case no.2001CV33385), was filed in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta Jan. 29. In addition to Nokia, the lawsuit names BellSouth Mobility, Inc., and the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (now the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association) as defendants. It seeks compensatory and punitive damages but doesn't list an amount. The 10-count lawsuit claims that the defendants \"knew or should have known\" the phones \"to be defective, unreasonably dangerous, and hazardous.\" Spokespersons for the defendants declined to comment on the lawsuit. ******************************************************* ILECs: `DISTORTIONS' FROM `RECIP COMP' COULD GET WORSE Incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) say their reciprocal compensation payments to competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) are continuing to increase, making it even more imperative that the FCC change its rules regarding the payments between carriers for terminating local traffic. The ILECs told the FCC that declining network costs and increasing traffic flows are producing \"ever greater economic inefficiencies and distortions.\" Robert T. Blau, vice president-executive and federal regulatory affairs at BellSouth Corp., addressed the issue in a Feb. 1 letter to Common Carrier Bureau Chief Dorothy Attwood. He wrote on behalf of BellSouth, SBC Communications, Inc., Verizon Communications, Inc., and Qwest Communications International, Inc. Mr. Blau acknowledged that reciprocal compensation rates are declining, but he said dial-up traffic to the Internet is increasing faster. Most observers project that dial-up access minutes will continue to grow rapidly for at least the next three years, Mr. Blau said. In addition, changes in technology and capital cost reductions are \"offsetting reciprocal compensation declines,\" he said. Mr. Blau estimated that the cost to CLECs of carrying dial-up calls to Internet service providers (ISPs) \"works out to about $0.0001 per minute, or about 2% to 5% of current reciprocal compensation rates.\" He said eliminating reciprocal compensation in favor of a \"bill-and-keep\" system would not force CLECs to raise per-line fees for ISP customers. ******************************************************* NEWS IN BRIEF Former National Telecommunications and Information Administrator Gregory L.

Telecom Italia SpA intends to raise as much as 12.8 billion euros ($12 billion) by exchanging ordinary shares for a lesser class of stock called savings shares. Shareholders who participate in the exchange would pay Telecom Italia 6.25 euros per share ($5.87) to upgrade their stock. Telecom Italia would use the proceeds to buy back up to 10% of its ordinary shares, including those held by parent company Olivetti SpA. If the share exchange and buyback go as planned, Olivetti's stake in Telecom Italia would drop from 58.4% to about 40%.

In most cases, applicants must obtain frequency coordination through a certified coordinator before their paperwork can be approved. Phase II of the conversion of the land mobile radio services to the ULS took effect last October, APCO pointed out. But no public- certified frequency coordinator successfully has submitted an application electronically to the FCC, it said. The new ULS forced frequency coordinators to redesign their software in just a few months, APCO said.... The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission says it will establish two numbering-relief planning committees to develop telephone number resource-allocation plans. CRTC plans to form a committee to assess numbering needs within area code 519; another committee will study area codes 613 and 819. The committees will submit to the CRTC relief-implementation proposals that, if approved, would require mandatory compliance by all telecom carriers serving those areas, the CRTC said today.... The FCC has renewed the charter of the Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC) for two more years, beginning Feb. 25. The NCC advises the agency on technical and operational standards for the 700 megahertz band interoperability channels. ******************************************************** TR DAILY Copyright 2001 Telecommunications Reports International, Inc., (ISSN 1082-9350) is transmitted weekdays, except for holidays.

        "content": "Master Netting Agreement Attached below is our preliminary draft master netting agreement. As we discussed last week, the draft is designed to be relatively simple and \"user friendly,\" accommodating a single Enron entity and a single counterparty entity engaged in cash settled and physically settled transactions under separate, pre-existing, respective financial and physical master agreements similar to those which you have provided to us as examples. We note a few points about the attached draft: 1. The terms \"master netting agreement\" and \"master netting agreement participants\" in Section 6 refer to proposed definitions that would be added to the Bankruptcy Code upon enactment of the pending legislation. If an agreement is executed with a counterparty prior to enactment (or if the legislation is not enacted), we would amend this provision to incorporate instead the existing safe harbor provisions to the extent possible. 2. We designated Texas law as the governing law (in brackets) based on the provisions of the ISDA schedule you provided to us. 3. Notwithstanding that the draft contemplates a single Enron entity, we included references to Enron affiliates in certain provisions to provide flexibility in the event that obligations from other Enron entities to the counterparty should arise in any other context. We think that all such obligations should be available for setoff against Enron's claims against the counterparty. Please call us when you have had an opportunity to review the draft.

Based on a 'cold day' index, the deal protects the Rock Garden from a summer that has too many days below a certain temperature between March and June. Once a number of days has been reached, the Rock Garden will receive a payout for each further day below that reference temperature. The payouts have been weighted to reflect the greater earning potential in some months compared to others. In a blind auction, Enron beat six other risk takers to price the deal.

The Product DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange and execute transactions efficiently and effectively. Companies that license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, track and close a transaction online. DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the transaction process for licensees: Document Sharing: deal-related materials in various formats (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures, etc.) can be uploaded for deal participants to view and/or edit. Auctioning/Bidding: licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender bids. Multi-media: customers can present high quality virtual road shows and asset descriptions using streaming video. Secure Communication: DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many communication. Deal Management: DealNotesTM enables customers to monitor the progress of their deals using statistics on user downloads, bidding/auction results and user page views. Applications DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for the new headquarters building. Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide for the hosting of online datarooms. To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding this Enron Net Works initiative.

I noticed that one of the packages is less than 1 year in term. This means it could also be bid up in excess of max rate. Anything over 1 year could only be bid to max rate.

Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for your review. Please note the following as you review: 1. The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer's utility. 2. I did not include a \"Setoff\" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another agreement in place with these customers. If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so. 3. The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past). Taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a \"force majeure event\" in an effort to soften the approach (see the GTCs). Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the interest of \"saving space\" than anything else... Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched. If you are comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms. Thanks again for your help with this project, Marianne P.S. Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my \"hiatus\" -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16.

Once the net NYISO clearing account impact from these billings was determined, an adjustment was computed based upon customers' respective ratio shares of transmission service settled during each month, adjust these costs out of their settlements.

        "content": " mlokay.nsf Transport Options - In response to our recent FERC filing, a technical conference has been scheduled in Washington D.C. for January 9, 2001. Fuel Hedge - With gas prices running at record highs, we hedged 5,000 MMBtu/d of fuel for calendar 2002 at $4.50, then unwound it the following day as the market dipped allowing us to book a small gain in excess of $100,000. We expect prices to jump again next week with the oncoming cold snap and we'll likely reset the hedge at higher numbers. PNM - TW's response to PNM's request for transport proposal went out this week. They are paying max rates on an East to East contract and indicated to us they feel the rates are not currently supported by the market.; TW however disagrees. Our response to them leaves the current rate structure in place but has two additional tiers of volumetric incentive pricing. As their volume increases, their rates go down. In addition, we added a seasonal IT rate to the proposal that helps them meet any swing gas demand requirements. Albuquerque Lateral - ENA is meeting with IPP plant owners in the Albuquerque region who would like to see alternative sources of gas supply besides the local utility. If the operators expand the plant from a peaking unit to a combined-cycle unit, there is potentially enough load to justify a new delivery lateral off TW's mainline. Part of the deal structure may include a volume incentive rate as throughput increases in the lateral. Next step for TW is to build a rate matrix under several different operating scenarios. Responses are due to ENA by Friday 12/15. Black Mesa Project - We continue to evaluate the potential of converting the Black Mesa coal slurry line owned by Northern Border into gas service. The big advantage for TW is it will increase our capacity to bring San Juan gas to the California border but there is also a positive environmental play for Black Mesa and coal slurry along with Mohave and coal pollution affecting the Grand Canyon. This whole project is contingent on several factors, not the least of which is working with Mohave Generating Station majority owner AES (70%) to convert the plant to gas and working with the Navajo who could lose a large export market for their coal. ENA has agreed to approach AES on this project in the near future once their negotiations on the Las Vegas power plant are complete. Legal is checking the existing ROW to see if there are limitations on the pipe usage. Burlington Claim - We are assembling the volume and revenue impact figures of the November train derailment for submission to Burlington's claims adjusters.

        "content": " mmcconn.nsf Mike- As we discussed, the timing of the Gaza Transfer Agreement has once again become critical. This e-mail will give you some background as to the situation. We financially closed the $90MM loan for the Gaza project last June. There was a CP from the banks that the remaining $20MM of equity would not need to be in the Project company until a date in the future. This was done because the project was placing a $20MM IPO locally and it was not possible to complete the IPO before the debt financing. The IPO has been successfully subscribed; however, Enron has been blocking the transfer of the IPO funds into the project company as we must have certain minor share transfers completed prior to the transfer of the IPO funds in order to solidify our U.S. tax deferral structure. One of the covenants of the debt financing is that we must maintain a certain debt to equity ratio in order to be able to draw more debt. The project has now reached the point in which it can no longer draw debt proceeds until the remaining $20MM of equity (the IPO funds) are transferred into the project account as these equity funds are required in order to allow for our debt/equity ratio to be preserved. The timing of this issue is being driven by the fact that the project has to pay interest and commitment fees to the bank on the 3rd of January. The only source of these payments are the IPO funds that must be transferred. As mentioned above, Enron requires several minor share transfers in order to preserve the U.S. tax deferral structure (5 or 10 shares need to be exchanged in several companies in the chain). These transfers must take place before the IPO funds are put into the Project Company. The language of these minor transfers have been agreed among the partnership. However, the partners are refusing to execute these minor transfers until Enron executes the Transfer Agreement. When the Gaza project was being conceived, the former CALME management agreed to the Transfer Agreement and this agreement was memorialized in detail in the Joint Venture Agreement among the parties. The Transfer Agreement provides no party may have a change in control of their ownership in the project without the consent of the other parties. The JVA expressly states that this transfer restriction is to be entered into by Enron Corp. and that the restrictions on change of control apply all the way up the ownership chain to Enron Corp. as well as to the other partners ultimate parent entities. A draft of this Transfer Agreement has been previously reviewed by Mark Metts. Mark indicated that he was not comfortable with the nature of the agreement; however, this was last summer when Enron was re-evaluating its position with respect to its international assets and it was thought that the Gaza project may have soon not been part of Enron. The Gaza team has spent a great deal of time over the past six months trying to either soften the nature of the Transfer Agreement or to make the restriction apply to some entity lower in the ownership chain than Enron Corp. These efforts have been unsuccessful as the partners claim that the Transfer Agreement was a \"pillar\" of the deal that we had and furthermore that this deal had been agreed directly with very senior Enron personnel. Therefore, it appears that we must deal with the Transfer Agreement now in order to allow Enron to preserve its tax deferral position, transfer the IPO funds and ultimately allow the project to meet its debt service obligations to the bank on January 3rd. We have tried to bring this issue to a close sooner, but the parnters have delayed resolution until now. The timing of this is unfortunate, but probably not accidental from our partners position. You may reach me at any time at 502.458.4985 (through Thursday afternoon) or at 713.522.4802 (home) or 713.818.9019 (mobile) beginning Thursday evening.

We can deliver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will give you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Station 65. That is the location for all price settlements. If we delivery at an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving downstream ( Station 85 ) and we pay the basis differential for moving upstream ( Sta 45, 30 ).

She is willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not think that would be worthwhile. My opinion at this point is that she can do it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific information. I welcome your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me. Thanks for your thoughts. Michelle "

One of the matters which has been delegated to me is the review of a Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement between EES and A'lones. I met with Richard Ring yesterday, and he indicated that you might be able to answer a few questions. First, Richard has informed me that ENA was heavily involved in the development of this document, and, as a result, the form is used \"as is\" and without amendment, save for information to be provided in the Cover Sheet. One of my \"marching orders\" is that choice of law provisions in EES paper should require Texas law. The Edison form opts for New York. Is this something that can be changed? Second, what about more substantive matters, such as who takes the lead in sending transaction confirmations? In the A'lones transaction, it is contemplated that EES will be the Buyer. The Edison form places primary confirmation obligations on the Seller. I am informed that EES prefers to be the confirming party, regardless of whether it is the buyer or seller. Is this something that can be changed? Third, there are a variety of typographical and reference errors. i.e. double commas (see paragraph 2.2), doubled phrases (paragraph 5.1(h)(i)), and possibly mistaken use of defined terms (see use of \"Product\" in second line of paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2). What is the Company's position on correcting these types of items?

I suggest that we schedule a meeting to make sure (1) that, as per our previous discussions, Stephanie or whichever legal assistant working on brokerage agreements are tracking the agreements sent out and creating the brokerage agreement files once the Agreements are executed. Also, we want to make sure everyone knows where to go when you need certain documents/where these files are located and what is supposed to be in them. (I think they were just moved from Samantha's desk to Stephanie's desk, right?) (2) I recommend that once we get the executed documents, we need a legal assistant to record the account numbers and execution dates in lotus notes when she receives the documents. (3) Also, I want to make sure that we are keeping a file on Authorized Trader announcements and changes. I want to resuugest that the legal assistant also needs to send some type of form letter to the pre-existing firms to give notice when the list of authorized traders changes - this is critical, especially now that there are so many accounts and so many changes. Maybe we can draft a form letter and have a template or something. We should also create a list of contact persons to whom such a list has to go to. (4) Also, now that we have more another legal assistant, we should meet to discuss how the assistant can \"take back\" some of the tasks I had taken on to make life easier without such help - getting signatures, preapring the documents, calling the counterparty etc. This will free-up some much needed time to review ISDA's, Confirms etc. (5) Which legal assistants will work on what?

I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine. Now, for the Important Question.

        "content": "CPUC affiliate entity jurisdiction PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION Jeff, Per your request, I am writing a brief note to follow up on our telephone conversation today. As we discussed, Enron plans to change the structure of Enron Telecommunications, Inc. from a regular C corporation to an LLC. As we discussed previously, this change in structure will require the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission, because it is a change of control under the definitions of the Public Utilities Code. You indicated that someone inside Enron was concerned that, during the course of the CPUC's review of the request for transfer of control, the CPUC could get access to the books and tax returns of ETI's parent EBS or other Enron entities, which Enron would find unattractive. You asked me to discuss whether this was possible. At a general level, the CPUC in the past has asserted jurisdiction over entities affiliated with entities regulated by the CPUC. Depending on the facts at hand, a variety of provisions in the PU Code grant this jurisdiction. However, the CPUC rarely uses its jurisdiction to look into the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant telecommunications carrier, unless the affiliate is the entity seeking to acquire control of the carrier. For nondominant telecommunications carriers, the Commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch, because such carriers have no market power. You should also be aware that there are other provisions in the PU Code that protect carrier's financial information from public disclosure. Thus, although it is possible that the Commission would seek to review the books and/or tax returns of EBS or another Enron entity in connection with the change to an LLC, it is unlikely. ETI is a nondominant carrier, and there is no real change in the ownership of ETI, because EBS will still be ETI's owner (i.e., EBS will own an LLC, rather than a C corporation), nor is there any change in the management personnel of ETI. The one wild card is that Enron's name is quite well known to the Commission because of Enron's presence in the energy market. While this logically and legally should make no difference, it could conceivably trigger increased Commission scrutiny of the transfer of control. Please let me know if you need more information or want to discuss further. SPB "

As a result, we will need to replace letterhead and business cards for all affected employees at our offices here in the U.S. There are two separate groups of employees affected by this change: first, the employees who are now reporting into one of the global functions (i.e., risk management or technology); second, those employees who focus their efforts on the Enron North America business. Those employees reporting at the global function level should have business cards and letterhead with Enron Corp. as the company name. Those who continue to focus activities on Enron North America will need to replace existing ECT business cards and letterhead with Enron North America stationery. If you have questions on which company needs to go on your stationery, please check with your management before submitting requests. Please follow the instructions below in replacing these items. Generic Letterhead: Enron North America: Letterhead for the Houston, Portland, Denver and New York offices will be ready for ordering/delivery by August 27th. You should begin using this letterhead for all correspondence effective September 1st. You may use the order form attached below to request this item. It should be completed, then faxed or e-mailed to the Image Center for processing. Form numbers for these items are as follows: Houston Form # 413-05272 Portland Form # 413-05995 New York Form # 413-05774 Denver Form # 413-05096 San Francisco Form # 413-05397 Enron Corp.-Houston Office: Letterhead is available immediately. The Order# is 011-01350. Non-Executive Business Cards: Please complete the Personalized Stationery Request Form (attached below) and fax it to The Image Center. Requests will be processed on a first-come, first-serve basis. Timing on these cards should run 5-7 working days from the time the approved proof is returned. Executive Letterhead/Business Cards: Please complete the Personalized Stationery Request Form (attached below) and fax it to The Image Center. They will process requests on a first-come, first-serve basis. Keep in mind that personalized stationery is embossed and engraved, generally taking 10-15 working days to complete. While awaiting executive stock, it is recommended that you use the generic letterhead and either continue to use your ECT business cards, or place an order for non-executive, flat-print business cards. These cards can be done much faster than the embossed/engraved stock. Envelopes: There will be no changes made to the existing envelopes. Mailing Labels: If you currently have mailing labels that have ECT on them, please replace these with Form #000-0960. For questions related to ordering these items, or to check on the status of your request once you have submitted your Order Form, you may contact Charles O'Kechukwo on 713/853-5408, Ruby Kinsfather at 713/853-3869 or Scott Terrell at 713/853-3386.

        "content": " darron giron 6-26-02.PST As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently. Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee. This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees. The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11. Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections. Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain. From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun. Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed. We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future. Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week. This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company. By now, you must have heard of \"NETCO.\" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business. Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership. We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO. It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO. The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder. We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January. As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention. This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee. We will update you periodically on our process. Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization. Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley. Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee. Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently. In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp. Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis. Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development. In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation. Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon. Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM. As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan. Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December: Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO. We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling. Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term. We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process. We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal."

I hope you will consider my thoughts carefully since I have had active involvement in the process from its inception and believe that I can offer some advice that should be considered. It appears that the results of the process have become too demoralizing to the employee being reviewed. Even those that do well are suspicious of the process and don't particularly like it. It causes a great deal of stress on employees and creates an atmosphere of cynicism among the people thatshould be supportive of it. There is a belief that the process is arbitrary and that no one gets a fair hearing based on their performance but rather the results are skewed by the negotiating skills and argumentative success of any particular reviewer. The biggest single complaint seems to be thefact that an employee can be told after one review period that they are excellent and six months later be told they are only satisfactory or worse. While the employee's performance may have suffered during that period of time, the message that they hear is not necessarily that their performance has declined but rather that they as an individual are not valued and are notas good as they were six months earlier. We are mixing the message between the worth of the individual and the results of their performance. The following is my recommendation to improve on this system: SEPARATE THE PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES 1. Employee Skill, Competency and Character - This category measures apersons inherent skill, talent, intelligence and commitments to Enron's values. This determinant should not change drastically between each review period since it measures whats inside a person and that should only change slowly or with the development of new skills or the hiring of new and betterqualified employees. In this category a person could be told whether theyare excellent or superior or average and know that they have an opportunity to improve on that ranking through their own effort while also realizing that we are continually trying to raise the bar with new hires. This particular performance measurement is also a measure of the success of our hiring and training program. 2. Employee Performance - This a measure of how well an employee is performing the tasks of any particular job. This measure could fluctuate muchmore than the first since each person's performance can vary greatly over time based on many different circumstances. This measure would also distinguish those employees who may not be considered to have the best skills or greatest intelligence but who through sheer hard work and determination areoutstanding performers. It should also help identify those who are under performing and not living up to their potential as measured by the first category. This category also measures our skill as managers and leaders of people since it is often the managers job to motivate people to perform above and beyond their own capability. 3. Results - This is a measure of the financial performance and result of the effort of any individual employee. I believe this criteria is most suited to the commercial employees and should be the major determining factor (but not the only on) in annual bonus payments. This should be closely correlated to the Job Performance criteria but it may not always be since some people may be working on a long term project which has a payback at some future date or in the other extreme someone could have lucked out by being in the right place at the right time and gaining the benefit from it without the appropriate effort. In addition to these three categories I would also reduce the Job Descriptions that are included in the PRC process. I think it is a waste of timeto include clerks, assistants, accounting personnel and other non managercommercial support people in the process. Very little is gained by them or by management and a tremendous amount of stress and ill will is created. I would also reduce the amount of time spent on the PRC at mid year and only focus on the first two performance categories at that time. I would also change the time when the PRC review is done since now it happens in the summer when many people are trying to scheduled vacations and at year end when there is so much other business activity going on. I think a March, September schedule would work much better. There are probably many other ideas to improve the PRC process and I am sure that you are working on them. Please give my ideas some thought and see if they don't merit some consideration. "

        "content": "Pueblo I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager for the Pueblo project. I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts team might be helpful. He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next week or the following week. Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington. Harrington is the key--he is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my old firm in DC. The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all through their sole source strategy, including their legal interpretations and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD. Bill and Bill--does such a meeting sound productive? If so, should we have outside govt. contracts counsel present and if so, who do you suggest? On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that he was in the middle of a \"big drafting project\"--revising Dennis' joint venture agreement with the Isleta. I took the opportunity to express my concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board. I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit turbines. Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with money, turbines, etc. If Enron does eventually decide to get into this deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be revisited. Thanks for your patience on this project. DF "

        "content": " mary-hain.nsf The following are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement. In the sixth \"whereas\" (page 1) (and Sections 3.4 and 5.1.6) the contract states that either the generating company or the generating company's customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for transmission service. In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed. Specifically, a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability (or privity of contract) to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific. For example, the generator may sell the power to Dynegy, who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service. The eighth \"Whereas\" (page 1) (and Sections 2.18, 3.1, 31.7, E.4.1, E.4.2, E.8.2, E.8.3, E.8.4, E.8.6, E.8.7, E.11.10, E.11.11, and E.12.) state the generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability Management System (RMS) Agreement. I would like to point out that some generators do not like to commit to the \"good utility\" practice standard or to be bound by the RMS agreement. Enron has signed the RMS Agreement. I doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility practice standard. This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and, in order for RTO West to form, BPA must agree to join. Enron is very interested in RTO West forming. If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard, we had better develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable alternative standard. Section 1.1 Contrary to our requests, this section still states that the agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become effective. This is not the way the OATT operates. Rather, if Enron and Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement, Enron asks Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC (as we have done) and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierra's open access tariff. Service here is governed by the transmission open access tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT applies. The FERC has determined that filings under Section 212 (and therefor 211) of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the customer simply requests service under the OATT. Requiring the customer to wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would completely undermine the purpose of Order No. 888. Section 1.2 After, \"by both parties\" add \"however, if the parties cannot agree to execute this agreement, System Owner shall file this agreement unexecuted with FERC as provided by the terms of the OATT.\" Section 1.6.2 Three years advance written notice is too long. A reasonable notice period would be ____. Section 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 EPMI opposes the definitions of \"Applicable Laws\" \"Applicable Permits\" and \"Applicable Reliability Criteria\" because, when combined with their use throughout the contract (in Sections 2.6, 3.5, 3.10, 3.11, 5.6.2, 5.6.3, 8.4.2, 11.8, E.2.8, E.3.3, E.4.1, E.4.3, E.4.4, and E.9.5) they subject EPMI to legal and regulatory risk by consenting to amendment of the contract by government action. Section 2.19 Section (i) of the definition of \"Dispatch gives Sierra too much control over the generating unit by allowing it to redispatch for \"the most reliable\" supply. Change \"the most reliable\" to \"a reliable\" Section 2.31 Is inconsistent with Sierra's OATT. It should be written using the same words as the OATT. Section 2.52 The reference to Section 22.1 should be corrected to 21.1. Section 2.56 Definition of \"System Integrity\" is too broad. When combined with Section 3.13.2, it would require our generator to not \"have an adverse impact on \"maximiz[ing] the health, welfare, safety of personnel and the general public.\" While Sierra can voluntarily do so with its own facilities, there is no reliability or governmental requirement that we do so and we should not. Section 3.5 The proposed Use of \"System Integrity\" here is more fair assuming EPMI agrees to the \"Good Utility Practice\" standard. Section 3.7 Shouldn't the word \"unplanned\" be added before the word Outages? Section 3.8 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it would be directly assigned the cost of facilities that are being used by others. Section 3.10 The second sentence exposes EPMI to regulatory risk by allowing Sierra to add new facilities and charge them to EPMI. This risk is increased by the last sentence which allows Sierra to determine the need for such facilities in its sole discretion. Editorial note: the third to last sentence is missing a period. Section 3.13.2 See comments under Section 2.56. Section 4.1 EPMI opposes the first sentence because it gives Sierra an opportunity to have FERC order additional payments for the same level of service already provided by this contract. Accordingly, the words \"or ordered by FERC\" should be deleted. EPMI opposes the second sentence because it would allow Sierra, with FERC's approval, to allocate to EPMI costs incurred for Sierra property and for operation of Sierra's facilities Section 4.3 Should the words \"generating company's applicable FERC-approved tariff\" be changed to \"Applicable Law?\" Section 5.1.1 EPMI opposes the last sentence because it would presumably require EPMI to pay more than cost for any project whose scope does not increase by more than 10 percent. Under FERC's precedent, EPMI is only required to pay actual cost. Section 5.1.3 Nine months seems like to long a time to wait to provide a final invoice. The words \"plus Interest\" should be added after the words \"difference\" in the fourth sentence. Section 5.6.2 This section says essentially the same thing as Section 3.10 and EPMI opposes it for the same reasons. Section 6.4.3 Add period at end of sentence. Section 7.1 Delete period after the word \"and\" in last sentence. Section 8.1.4 Add period after \"Interconnection Facilities.\" Section 8.4.2 EPMI opposes paying for all modifications to interconnection facilities to the extent that such modifications benefit Sierra or third parties. Section 8.7.2 Delete the word \"and\" on the seventh line. Section 9.1.1 See comments under Sections 2.56. Section 11.7 Delete \"pen-nits\" from last line on page and insert \"permits.\" Section 11.8 After \"remediation or abatement activity\" insert \"pay all fines, penalties, or compensations as required by law.\" Section 13.4 There should be a reciprocal provision for generators. Section 16.2 EPMI opposes \"regulatory\" Force Majeure. Section 16.6 This provision is too broad in that it allows the System Operator to evaluate the alternatives available to the EPMI. Section 17.9 Add the letter \"y\" after \"and ma\" on the second line. Section 19.2.1 Third to last line change \"ahs\" to \"has.\" Section 19.3 Needs to be edited. Section 19.6 This section subjects EPMI to the regulatory risk of amendment to the interconnection agreement to conform to an RTO's requirements. Section 22.5 By law, System Operator should be required to file with FERC prior to terminating the connection. Section 31.8 This section exposes EPMI to regulatory risk because it allows Sierra to unilaterally file with FERC to change the terms and conditions of the interconnection contract. This is standard in utility tariffs and agreements and in fact is in the FERC's pro forma OATT under Order No. 888. Section 31.9 of the contract retains EPMI's rights to protest any unilateral filing by Sierra under Section 31.8 and seems to balance the rights given to Sierra in Section 31.8 by allowing EPMI to file a complaint challenging any of the rates, terms, or conditions, etc., of the interconnection agreement. Exhibit D D.1.1 EPMI should not be required to provide free station service to the extent it benefits Sierra Pacific or third parties. A higher level of service should not simply be at the election of the System Owner but rather at the agreement of the Parties. D.1.2 The phrase \"Except under Applicable Law,\" should be added before the first sentence. D.2 EPMI opposes providing free VArs and opposing providing VArs at a level determined by Sierra's discretion. Accordingly, EPMI opposes this entire provision. If Sierra wishes to purchase VArs, EPMI would agree to provide ______ level of VArs at ____ rate. EPMI would also agree to provide VArs at Sierra's discretion, subject to this rate, in the case of an Emergency. Otherwise, EPMI would be foregoing the opportunity to provide real power (instead of VArs) to the market at a market-based rate, and it might be subject to having such transactions cut at Sierra's \"discretion\" without being assured the cost of cover. Accordingly, the rate standard of cost or foregone revenues would not be compensatory. D.3 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it could be read to require EPMI to provide free Black Start Service. D.4 Since the generator is not taking the delivery portion of transmission service, it is not required to buy or self provide any ancillary service including regulation and frequency response service of real-time load -following service. Accordingly, this provision should be deleted. D.5 EPMI opposes the second sentence of this paragraph and it should be deleted. Sierra should get ancillary services from the market. E.2 Change \"minimized\" to \"minimize.\" E.2.4 Oppose requirement to notify Sierra of defects in generator \"may affect System Integrity.\" E.4.1.3 EPMI opposes giving the Control Area Operator authority to \"approve\" Planned Outage Schedules. E.4.4 Once again EPMI would oppose the use of the term \"System Integrity\" here as too high as standard. E.6.5 The second sentence gives the Control Area Operator too broad authority to preclude Planned Outages. E.7.1 Add the word \"the\" on line 4 after \"at.\" E.8.1 EPMI opposes requiring the Generator to receive prior Control Area Operator authorization to undertake any action that is \"reasonably likely to have an adverse impact of System Integrity,\" especially adjustment of the amount of real and reactive power it delivers to the Transmission system under E.8.1.1. E.8.2.2 Because VArs could be sold as real power, System Control should not be allowed to \"establish the range of voltages or voltage schedules.\" Rather, Sierra Pacific should negotiate with EPMI to buy the level of voltage support it requires. See also E.8.9 establishing power factors. E.8.4 EPMI does not have a problem with operating its AGC within WSCC limits but it will not be providing this Ancillary Service free to Sierra. We need to negotiate compensation. E.8.6 Giving Sierra \"sole discretion\" to determine \"unacceptable deterioration of the quality of service over its Transmission System\" is too broad. E.9.2 \"Repots\" should be \"reports\""

I believe that it is intended to eliminate any confusion that historically arose during the debate between \"First Method\" (one-way payments) and \"Second Method\" (two-way payments) for Early Termination purposes. Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a governmental. The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District. For those of you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA. Because these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions. The Part 5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement. It was included in the \"Event of Change\" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the ISDA concept of \"Illegality\", a \"Termination Event\"). I think it was probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT form.

        "content": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans Two years ago Enron North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash application rather than SAP AR. We decided at the time that SAP AR would be kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface. We believe that the business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP. I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below. Two Years Ago Today Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in place. Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of existence of signed agreement. Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time. Canada nets across counterparties. Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain separate net statement process. ENA considering netting physical and financial together. All account coordinators were to apply their own cash. Cash applied centrally in Power, Financial and Canada Individual coordinators apply cash only in physical Gas. Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team. Although gas settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by financial settlements. The company has not made any move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team. The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line tool. Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing data, rather than using the on-line functionality. Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed. Overpayments would be classified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system. Case management system does not exist. Allowing overapplication helps the account coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account. The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the counterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice. Given the number of legal entities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties have, this seems like a hopeless battle. Allowing cross-application of cash seems easier. Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash movement. Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash movement. Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways: Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face two problems in Unify. Controls built into Unify are already obsolete. Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) impossible. Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable within SAP. However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at the time of finaling a payment in Unify. To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to SAP AR. We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss. Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments. We WILL make this decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any additional time for consideration. Stephen "

Steve's only questions centered around the ENA payment guarantee and Northwestern's guarantee. He needs to understand from a legal perspective how these will be provided to GE (i.e. if both ENA and NW will issue stand alone guarantees). I told him that ENA will guarantee the remaining currently scheduled payment obligations under the contract. He is also awaiting receipt of the letter you're putting together.

The following is an update on the status of our effort to resolve/clear past due receivable items currently sitting in the a/r aging report. A/R-Imbalances, Transportation, Late Pay charges The attached report reflects all of the remaining A/R items over 30 days related to imbalance, transportation and late pay charges including any unapplied cash. Gas Logistics has worked very diligently to ensure the A/R is up to date. Where there were problems, they recruited the help of Marketing and were very successful in bringing closure to some A/R issues. The items to be included in the write off package (totaling ($3,486.75)) are designated as such and summed separately on the attached report. Gas Logistics has provided explanations/resolution plans in the right hand column of the report. To summarize the report, there is exposure of $1,534,792. Of that, $1,563,897 is made up of four customer issues (Hutchinson Utilities, IES Industries, MidAmerican Energy and Utilicorp-CCI bankruptcy). There are currently reserves set up for MidAmerican, $221,429 and Utilicorp, $98.496. Beginning immediately Gas Logistics will include an aging report for all outstanding a/r as part of the customer accounts status package. This package has been and will continue to be distributed to all account managers monthly. Gas Logistics has the initial responsibility to collect payments from shippers and will involve the account manager when an issue or collection problem occurs. However the account manager will also have the responsibility to keep themselves informed as to the status of their shippers accounts. The reports provided to them in the customer accounts status package will help them do so. Work orders Outstanding work order receivables are being researched and reconciled by Tim Bayles in John Cobb's organization and they plan to resolve these balances independent of the transportation-related effort. Currently it is our understanding there is approximately $1.2m of outstanding work order receivables with $.6 reserved in December, 2001. Mike McGowan has offered Laura Lantefield's assistance with getting these resolved. OBA's OBA's were not originally included as part of our a/r focus however Gas Logistics is already putting the same effort into resolving/clearing any OBA issues. Currently OBA's over $200,000 are included in the customer accounts status package. Gas Logistics is preparing a report similar to the a/r report for OBA's under $200,000. This report will indicate which OBA's are reconciled and which ones need a resolution plan. Please let Lynn or I know if you have any further questions. Dana Dana L.

To that end, I've asked Harry Kingerski to focus his time and efforts more fully on developing his support group's (Government Affairs Support Services) capabilities, with an objective of broadening their support beyond EES and ENA. With the void that Harry leaves in formally directing our group's efforts on behalf of EES, I've asked Jim Steffes to assume a leadership role with respect to EES as well as ENA. I've also asked Lisa Yoho to assume responsibility for Enron Industrial Markets in addition to her responsibility for Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks. No further organizational changes are being made at this time but, as always, organizational flexibility in how our group responds to the needs of the business units will be the order of the day. I am confident that all of us will support Harry, Lisa and Jim with their additional responsibilities. Thank you."

This document has been prepared by experienced groups of professionals with foreign support on terms of credit and legal issues. My impression is that will be competing against that document in a great deal of disadvantage. This disadvantage will be a \"cultural\" disadvantage from the moment that latin american countries tend to have \"shorter\" documents written in the local language where the transaction is taking place. If the ISDA was at least written in Spanish (rather than French or German) it would be of great help. This is an issue that really \"tickles\" me: Why isn't the ISDA document translated into Spanish being that it is after English probably the language most spoken through out the globe and second that there's much more opportunity of selling Risk Management Products to Latin American countries rather than French companies through my more than disappointing experience in trying to close a deal with French Total. I believe Sara's visit would be more that important. I'll try to forward everybody a copy of the document that was drafted in Argentina for everybody's info. I strongly believe in the matters of evolution and I'm sure that in the future ESA's market will mature in such a way that will just like Enron Europe a document to match market's needs. "

This posting is the 30-day (actually 26-day) notification prior to the Board's vote. A. Phase IIB Planning Standards (TTC and ATC) The Phase IIB Standards (TTC and ATC) were approved by the Market Interface Committee at its January 10-11, 2002 meeting and by the Planning Committee by mail ballot on January 23, 2002.

Entities Responsible for the Reliability of the Interconnected Transmission System 2. Local Network 3. Regional Process 4. Radial Customer 5. User of the Interconnected Electric Systems The Planning Committee approved the complete list of terms and their definitions by mail ballot on January 23, 2002.

Following Board approval, these Planning Standards will be available for formal implementation of reviews for compliance under the NERC Compliance Program. No further Planning Standards will be developed and approved under NERC's 1997 Standards process. The Standards, if approved by the Board, will remain in effect until they are replaced by NERC Organization Standards. Sincerely, Angie Nicastro Secretary-Engineering "

At a later date, we will be happy to negotiate in good faith concerning whether it would be mutually agreeable to amend those Underlying Master Agreements. This Master Setoff Agreement is simply not the vehicle in which to accomplish that goal. Regarding any concerns that this Master Agreement may not be enforceable in Europe (or because it covers various Underlying Master Agreements for deals in Europe), please note that Section 13 provides severability language that should operate to carve out the European agreements that might otherwise create enforceability problems.

Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding authority to do so. I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor revisions which I will do. 2). They are concerned about the warranty language which covers hazardous wastes in ? 4. They tell me that they have not done an environmental inspection of the property. They want to know if there have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on the property. They are looking for something in writing that no such sources existed. 3). Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31, 1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to Louisiana Resources Co., Inc. Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc. I have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy. 4). She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents. Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns. Keith"

We also attach a blackline of the agreement which separately indicates these most recent changes (as compared to the version which we sent to you on July 3, 2001)(the \"Incremental Blackline\"). The Incremental Blackline includes a number of changes which address concerns communicated by Ray Welch. Most importantly, we have removed the concept of set-off of obligations of the affiliates of non-defaulting parties. We have also reinserted the concept of \"Interruptible\" transactions; however, we have clarified that \"Baseload Gas\", \"Multi-Month Gas\" and \"Swing Gas\" transactions shall be firm. In addition to the foregoing, we have proposed a number of other amendments which help clarify the representations, obligations and transacting procedures under the agreement. For example, we have distinguished payment defaults from other failures as events constituting \"Defaults\". Similarly, we have amended the confirmation procedures of Article 2 to clarify the mechanics of transacting. As you saw in our previous comments, Enron Canada wants to clarify that, although the practice is to always send a Confirmation Notice, a transaction is not dependent on a Confirmation Notice. In addition, the Incremental Blackline includes amendments which eliminate the potential confusion/uncertainty which would arise in the event that Confirmation Notices were issued by both parties. Section 2.4 has been amended such that only one party confirms the transactions. In this case, because Enron Canada will be issuing the Confirmation Notices for all Enron Online transactions, we have inserted Enron Canada as the party to issue the Confirmation Notice for all transactions, subject to a three business day review period. Should you have any questions or concerns relating to our proposed changes prior to the meeting, please give me a call. You can reach me directly at (403) 974-6708. Regards, Mark Powell "

From: Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets, and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce the following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA. 1) Coverage/Origination: To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service companies and IPP's; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries. Downstream Coverage/Origination As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear that the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp. Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp. Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENA's existing energy commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also EES's energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel's chemicals, plastics and refined products risk management capability. These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg's leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering: a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision of paper risk management products; b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries; c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers Trust's global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to leadthe coverage activities in this business. This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing industries. Midstream Coverage/Origination a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group' activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect. We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of this group; b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. They will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring opportunities in the Western U.S. We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination efforts; c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group's activities will focus on the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio's of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group. In addition, Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect; d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructuring opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets. We have asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair, formerly of Enron Asia's development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join this newly formed business. 2) Commercial Transactions: The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA's efficiency in executing transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage. CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management. The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership, execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups. This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions: a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western Coverage/Origination Groups. The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy Lemmons joined Enron in 1992. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA's industrial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining, Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established. The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich. We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups. The senior members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud and John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix. We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups. The senior members of this team include Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert. We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend. Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams. Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group. The remaining four groups within CTG will remain largely unchanged. In addition, the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together. We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ENA's markets particularly in the industrial markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups. Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in North America by working with us to implement these changes."

        "content": " mlokay.nsf Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31. Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended. After a brief overview of the proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments. Here is a summary of the comments. Marketing affiliate concerns. BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system. In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA could purchase an \"out of the money\" call option essentially cost free, since its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back. Proceeds from ENA's ability to then \"move the market\" through the establishment of the long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line. BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to other shippers. Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service. Since TW will be the first pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as possible. Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage. TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program. If BP and others have serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that applies to all interstate pipelines. Right of first refusal. Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal. TW's response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff. Negotiated rate. BP's representative claimed that option contracts will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such. TW did not respond to this or discuss it further. However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate. Hoarding capacity. Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity. It was not clear why some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists. Perhaps because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier. TW acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers. Although TW did not commit to placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require TW to do so in a final order. Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC filing by mid-September. "

Although comments on Viking Cable can be made after the event, we would not be in a position to influence the policy published in the Notice.

SNAM/GAZPROM contracts: destination clauses are illegal, Commission to initiate proceedings after the Summer break; there will be no blue lining, meaning that in a contract where a clause is illegal, the Commission will press for the contract to be terminated, and not allow the contract to continue intact but the offending article 'blue lined' out.

        "content": "Audit Thanks for your message regarding the Model Risk project. I think it's a very important issue and really critical to Enron. The model risk represents a very significant exposure to the company: a wrong model results in bad decisions and eventually leads to accounting errors and incorrect financial statements. Here are my comments. 1. Reasons of model risk. The main source of model risk in Enron is omitted in your list. I think it's due to the fact that the responsibility for the final model approval and validation is dispersed in the organization and there no single unit/person that is vested with the authority to audit, approve and monitor valuation models. The popular perception is that this is done by the Research Group, but this could not be further form the truth. Given the way the organization evolved over the last few years, we became a group of internal consultants, working on highly specialized, partial problems (sometimes, we work on a project from A to Z, but it's an exception to the rule). It's imperative that this is communicated to the senior management in a precise, non-ambiguous way. I think that this is the main source of potential problems and the first shortcoming of the modeling process to be corrected. 2. I would expand point 3 in your draft (inappropriate application of models) and add two lower level points: a) wrong inputs b) incorrect model used for a given transaction. TVA is an example of point a: a transaction in case of which the inputs have not been being updated for an extended period of time in the past. 3. Under Control Strength you can mention that several audits of the Research Group model by Arthur Andersen and Darrell Duffie have been initiated at our insistence. "

The meeting would be to discuss steps being taken by the Alberta Government to address electricity pricing concerns. We intend to have GPC make the request on Tuesday Nov 13 with a view to the request itself attracting attention of senior government officials. 2) Hemstock/Keohane to instruct Blake Cassels & Graydon to prepare letter to Maury Parsons, Chairman of the Power Pool Council that communicates Enron's concern that approval of the rule changes proposed would offend the obligations of the PPC under the EUA and request PPC to entertain stakeholder input on these fundamental changes prior to approval, failing which we expect Enron would proceed with legal action. The letter would indicate Enron's preliminary concerns with the proposed rule changes and express a need to more fully consider the impact of the proposed changes. The letter will also emphasize that Enron is willing to work with the Power Pool to review the experience in other jurisdicitions with similar rule changes and present other options designed to address the concerns of the Power Pool respecting Alberta electricity pricing. Seabron Adamson and Derek Davies/John Zufferli will provide input on substantive concerns with the proposed rule changes. 3) Hemstock/Milnthorp to call Lorry Wilson, CEO of Power Pool, Dale McMaster COO Power Pool, Maury Parsons, Chairman, Power Pool Council, and Ron George, Power Pool Council Member prior to Blakes letter being sent to express Enron's procedural and substantive concerns with the proposed rule change. 4) Hemstock/Milnthorp to contact the following group of generation developers and encourage them to immediately contact Power Pool Council members to express concern with substance of these rule changes and the process under which they are being effected: i) Rick Kline - Chairman, Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta (Hemstock); ii) Dick Way - Vice-President, Regulatory Affairs, TransAlta (Hemstock); iii) Gary Bauer - President, Atco Power (Milnthorp); iv) Mike Broadfoot - President, Engage Energy (Milnthorp); v) Karl Johanson - Vice President, TransCanada Energy (Hemstock). 5) Hemstock/Dadson to request GPC and Enron Public Affairs consider media/government relations strategy, including potential Project Stanley impact, if Enron does proceed with legal action on this issue.

        "content": " skean.nsf On 5/17/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement (\"IA\") and procedures subject to modification. As I mentioned earlier, Entergy had adopted some of Enron's suggestion (in Enron's comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's loss of generation. All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not included with an interconnection request. Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve wholesale, as well as unbundled retail. Dismisses EPSA's call for a \"model\" and approves Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement, subject to modification. Agreed with Enron that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are responsible for their own negligence). Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to the IA, even if the IA does not repeat all those provisions. Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot accommodate \"receipt\" of power without expansion, the new generator must pay costs of expansion. Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions are pure \"interconnection\" and which are applicable when transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS). Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provide a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines). If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide. FERC will not initiate a \"generic\" proceeding at this time, but encourages all transmission providers to file procedures at FERC. Approves Entergy's credits for \"optional\" upgrades (required to transport power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of how the credits work. Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subsequent studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more intent to actually complete the project). This does not mean that failure to execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator may be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects. This is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection. Entergy will also post its queue on OASIS. Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating. Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, unless actual costs are $10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of studies). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency (or explain why that is inappropriate). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generator pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system. Entergy must submit a compliance tariff within 30 days. Let me know if you would like a copy of the order."

        "content": "BA Project Report Importance: High --------------------------------- Here is my list of some of the projects/contracts Andrea and I are involved in or working on (recent comments are in bold): TGS Secured Credit Facility--(Issue raised by Don Black regarding the feasibility of pledging linepack gas. We need to check with Robert George on this issue.) Imbedded Capital Contracts--(Scott Porter raised the issue of developing a new form of template with Andrea and asked that we discuss the issue with Robert George.) Distribution Contracts--The commercial group would like to have preapproved distribution contract forms available to give to customers so that the customer can submit them to the distribution company when electing a commercial bypass. Only two distributors have had their form approved by the ENARGAS. We are looking into what we can offer to our customers in the other distribution territories to speed the process of finalising distribution contracts with the LDCs to avoid long delays. ENARGAS Expedientes--ENARGAS has issued an order to Enron to amend three of its gas contracts to modify references to firm transportation and to unbundle the pricing. The ENARGAS also sent a letter to our customers which we feel overstepped their regulatory role. The meeting between Roberto Pensoti and Hector Formica was held last Thursday. Roberto had a follow up phone conversation with Hector on Friday and had a meeting Monday morning with Alicia Federico to get a feel for the amount of resistance we will get. We have been given a 30 day extension to respond to the order in order to have meetings with the ENARGAS and try to come to some resolution on this issue. The first meeting will be scheduled early next week. Neuquen Tax Assessment--Andrea has faxed or emailed the pertinent information regarding the stamp tax assessment on the Technical Assistance Agreement between TGS and EPCA to George Frumkin, Anna Sepulveda and Michelle Blaine who will co-ordinate with TGS and Perez Companc on the strategy for responding to the assessment. Michelle will call TGS outside counsel today in order to hire him to also represent EPCA. EPCA has filed its response to Neuquen using the arguments prepared by TGS on January 27. Michelle Blaine has requested information regarding what the next step by Neuquen might possibly be. We will look into the issue. Tax Lobbying--Jordan Mintz and Terry Thorn are proposing a series of meetings with government officials in late February and have asked Carlos Bastos to see if he can also arrange a meeting with Mr. Lenicov at that time. Issues include determining whether the stamp tax and turnover tax issues can be lobbied at the national level or only at the provincial level. There is a proposal that was floated that the turnover tax could be included in the VAT tax scheme which might solve the problem with the turnover tax. The focus of the meetings is to determine how a lobbying strategy can be developed and who should be involved in the actual lobbying process. Jordan Mintz is handing off the responsibility he had assumed on this issue to Jim Ginty. Jordan has asked Carlos Bastos to see if he can set up a meeting with Mr. Lenicov on March 11th or 12th since Terry Thorn can be in Buenos Aires on those days. Transportation Capacity Release Guidelines--Must review and comment on new ENARGAS proposed guidelines by February 5. Comments were made on February 5. Vandenfil--Vandenfil has filed for a pre-bankruptcy proceeding which has not yet been \"opened\" by the court due to the January recess. For the last three months Vandenfil has made their payments only after our sending them termination notices with a two business day cure period. The most likely scenario during the preliminary bankruptcy period is that our contract will be \"continued\" by the trustee giving us a priority in payment for ongoing deliveries of gas. After the preliminary bankruptcy is opened if we have not been served notice that our contract is \"continued\" within 30 days we would be allowed to terminate the contract. One of the risks that we face with this customer is that they may argue to the trustee that we cannot terminate the contract claiming we are providing a public service. Imasa Bid--Format of Enron's original proposal structure changed. Enron and Albanesi submitted joint termsheet to Central Puerto in November where Enron proposed signing two contracts with Central Puerto, one for the supply of all the gas transportation and another for the supply for 60 percent of the gas requirements and Albanesi proposed two contracts, one for supplying 40 percent of the supply of the gas and another for the building of the pipeline spur. Central Puerto is studying the proposals and has not responded as of January 25, 1999. Dow Pipeline Spur Feasibility Study--Enron and Dow are studying the feasibility of building a pipeline between TGS and two affiliates of Dow. Issues include determining whether our CEIASA shareholder and owners agreements preclude Enron from building spurs for end users and whether spurs that serve more than one customer can be built under current regulatory guidelines. Andrea will be putting together a short report based on her meeting with Nestor Martinez. A team meeting consisting of legal, regulatory, commercial, credit and structuring met yesterday to discuss the broad parameters of the Dow spur proposal. The commercial group is preparing a first draft of a build, operate and finance termsheet that they would like to present to the customer on Thursday to be reviewed by Robert George. Credit is still doing its analysis of the two proposed counterparties. Contract Review--Preliminary gas contract reviews for Central Puerto and Ave Fenix for Rob Rice and Federico Cerisoli. Gas Deals: Chauvco--20 day gas supply contract being drafted Cerro VanGuardia--Amendment to the gas sale agreement being drafted to cover negotiated changes to the take or pay provisions. Bagley--Two Offer letters sent to two Bagley entities for review, Enron was not the low bidder. I have been asked by to look into how other \"marketers\" are avoiding the turnover tax and thus be more competitive than we are. The customer is looking at the relative risks between firm distribution and interruptable distribution but is running up against a deadline for actually requesting a contract template for distribution services. The contract is slated to begin March 23, however, the distributor has 30 days to respond for requests for distribution services. Total--Spot master agreement proposed for transactions out of Neuquen. Short term draft offer for gas out of Chubut being reviewed by Total. A separate one year supply contract template supplied by Total is being reviewed. The customers template contains the same type of language that gave us Antitrust trouble in the PCR contract. Peidra Buena--Gas sale agreement for peaking gas. Final offer sent and Gas has started flowing. We are now working on a one year contract. A termsheet has been sent to the customer. Dow--Negotiating offer letter format for sale of gas to two Dow affiliates. Gas deal is related to but independent of the spur issue. A mark up of draft has been received the end of last week, Dow indicates that further comments are to be sent soon. Power Deals: We need to draft an output marketing form of contract for the purchase of electricity. Argentine Signatories: Scott Neal has approved a new structure for signatories in Argentina. I will work with Hope Duggan firm on the new POA's. "

        "content": " JSTEFFE (Non-Privileged).pst This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals. The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done. These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is \"significant potential for undue discrimination\" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative. Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny. FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the \"linchpin\" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates. During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was \"important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side,\" that \"all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines.\" Last week's proclamation should be considered \"a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend,\" he asserted. In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties \"are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk\" of such unequal treatment. FERC declared that a \"key factor\" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an \"appropriate material deviation\" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide \"adequate alternatives\" to other shippers. In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs. The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, \"we have reconsidered that holding\" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order. Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an \"adequate alternative,\" the commission observed. \"However, if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not include any such provision.\" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk, giving it \"an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,\" the commission pointed out. \"A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,\" FERC said, adding that \"such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.\" Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights \"is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated\" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language \"will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.\" Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become \"muddled.\" Through a \"tortured line of cases,\" FERC's definitions of allowable contracting practices were \"obscured,\" Breathitt said in welcoming the new \"common-sense\" approach. The \"tug of war\" that parties have engaged in over the past few years \"really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service\" are available to all shippers, she said."

The call went well. Staff was upbeat, interested, but (of course) non-commital. They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling. Timing. They asked when we wanted a OPUC order. Sue Ackerman suggested 9 months. Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame. Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker, but this transaction presented different issues than past cases. Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs. electric practices. Financing. Helman asked how NNG will finance the ($1.55 billion) cash portion of the purchse. Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFB/Merrill financing. Other Regulatory Review. Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company. We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt, intrastate. I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction. Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review, but that we expected the issues to be limited. Process. Nyegaard noted that Mark D. and Peggy F. had met with the Commissioners. He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary. I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process. I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details. We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission (after our application is filed). Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction. They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners (!!!!). We said that we weren't planning any addition private meetings. 2. Other parties Sue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday. Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call. Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for today's article. He questioned NNG's ability to finance the purchase of a larger company. In his private discussion with Sue, Jenks repeated his concern with NNG's ability to finance the transaction. The only other concern he raised was NNG's practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature. We were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGU--but left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyron--respectively. 3. Rate Conditions. We're still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition. At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNG's ROE earnings test. Under this approach, PGE would: (1) compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings; (2) create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized; (3) share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorized--above 300 basis points. The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case. Under this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze. Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause order--however, note that there have not been any show-cause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history. Fuel savings (resulting from the merer of gas procurement activities) would flow through automatically to ratepayers through NNG's PGA and through PGE's PCA (of its progeny). PGE is conducting an analysis of this mechanism to determine its impact on earnings. We will discuss this mechanism with all of you before discussing it further with NNG. 4. FERC Review We're pushing PGE and NNG to complete the data collection effort for CRA's market power analysis. A revised schedule for the FERC, SEC, OPUC and WUTC proceedings will be circulated by mid-week. --end--"

        "content": "Cleburne issues Daren, with Megan gone I just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the Enron payments owed to the Cleburne plant. The current issues are as follows: November Gas Sales $600,377.50 October payment to ENA for TXU pipeline charges $108,405.00 Cleburne receivable from Enron $708,782.50 Less: November Gas Agency Fees ($54,000.00) Net Cleburne Receivable from Enron $654,782.50 Per my discussions with Megan, she stated that about $500K of the $600K Nov gas sales was intercompany (desk to desk) sales, with the remainder from TXU. Are we able to settle any intercompany deals now? Are we able to settle with TXU? Additionally, you'll see that I included the Oct TXU payment in the receivable owed to Cleburne also. This is because I always pay Megan based upon the pipeline estimates in Michael's file, even though they are not finalized until the next month. Therefore in my November payment to Enron, I paid ENA for October's estimate, of which Megan would have paid the final bill on 12/26/01 when it was finalized. However, I had to pay the October bill directly last month, even though I had already sent the funds to ENA in November. Therefore, I essentially paid this bill twice (once to ENA in Nov & once to TXU in Dec). I deducted the November Agency Fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to Cleburne. Please advise as to the status of these bills. You can reach me at 713-853-7280. Thanks. James"

Here is my short summary: There are six transcripts. Five of them seem pretty good for us. One is truly awful. Transcript 1 (May 4, 2001): NRG's Bill Stone talks to John Zurita about trying to come to terms on the deal. No terms are finalized. Transcript 2 (May 4, 2001): Stone calls Zurita back and proposes a price that Zurita agrees to. However, Zurita makes it clear that although many of the terms have been agreed to, \"obviously we have to get agreements signed and get the lawyers involved and all that good stuff.\" Stone appears to recognize that the deal is not complete: \"So we're really not done. Fuck.\" Transcript 3 (May 8, 2001): Stone simply leave a voicemail for Chuck Decker asking to get a confirm of the deal. Transcript 4 (May 8, 2001): Stone talks to Decker. Decker says: \"Rogers Herndon is in charge of that. Okay? He has to put the pressure on the credit guys to get the credit shit put to bed. His words, and they're not exact, but they're pretty close to this, I consider the deal done, tell Bill the deal is done, assuming that the back offices communicate the needed information.\" Discussions are had about getting the credit folks together to iron out details. Transcript 5 (May 16, 2001) (THE BAD TAPE): Stone calls Zurita and sets him up, asking him a number of questions aimed at determining if there really is a binding and enforceable deal between the parties. When Stone asks \"why don't you just tell me where you guys think the deal is?,\" Zurita replies: \"I think -- I say the deal is done.\" Stone's next question: \"Well, let me ask a question. What happens if gas goes to two bucks tomorrow? Do you still consider the deal done?\" Zurita's answer: \"Yep.\" And there's more. Stone next asks: \"Are you guys going to stand on the deal for $70 for the five years? I mean, I just -- I mean, I just gotta know exactly where you stand.\" Zurita's answer: \"The deal is done, yes.\" Ouch. This is not good. Transcript 6 (May 18, 2001): Zurita calls Stone. They discuss credit terms. Stone makes several comments that indicate he realizes the deal is not done. (\"The only thing, the only thing I care about is how long it's going to take to have the agreement worked out\"); (\"What is my concern is how far away are theyfrom getting done?\"). Rogers, I am interested in your views after you have had an opportunity to review the tapes. Let's talk soon. For you others, please let me know if you want transcripts of the tapes. Andy P.S. -- Under the agreement we reached with NRG for exchange of the tapes, we must trade position papers with NRG on October 25, 2001. I will prepare the position paper later this week."

Centrans apparently plans to sell a piece of its interest to a Fund, in which Enron also owns and interest (although I do not know how much). We would represent Centrans in selling its interest to the Fund. I am not sure, but I do not get the sense from my conversation with my partner that Enron plans to take an active role in the Fund purchase. So, from a conflicts analytical standpoint, this would seem to be analogous to LeBoeuf representing a buyer in connection with the sale of an asset to a corporation in which Enron is a shareholder. Do you have any concerns with LeBoeuf representing Centrans on this sale? Are there any unique facts or circumstances here that you may be aware of that could create a potential problem from your standpoint? I assume this transaction would fall within your \"world\" but, if not, is there somebody else that I should check with on this? We understand that Thelen Reid & Priest is representing the Fund.

PG&E can confiscate gas if a scheduling party is not in compliance. The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO. EFO stands for Emergency flow order. Thanks, Kim Dan J Hyvl 04/04/2001 04:31 PM To:\"Kolling, Grant\" <grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us>, Kim Ward/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject:RE: Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement Grant, I have removed the red-line from the above document. If it is in order,please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signature by Enron. I will attach a list of current traders who might be availableto handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have a certificate of incumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return afully executed contract for your files. Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers of the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties. Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and yourtransporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification. Likewise, ifEnron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO notification, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such failure.Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make their receipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled volumes. I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that the OFO provisions apply. Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I canverify with the transport group. "

For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical. Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept. The purpose of this note is twofold. First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here. I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly. Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts. I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York. Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor. At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family. I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!). Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Lavorato, The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915. Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank. 2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient. For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX. REGARDS MARIA.

I apparently did something wrong with the addressing, and many of the messages were \"returned to sender.\" I am re-sending it, just to be sure that everyone receives notice of the February 7 meeting. Thank you. Frank Lindh Pacific Gas and Electric Company (415) 973-2776 CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOCUMENT PER CPUC RULE 51 INTERESTED PARTIES: Based on discussions with a number of parties, we have determined that there is general support for a one-day informational Gas Accord II Workshop on Wednesday, February 7, 2001. Accordingly, PG&E will host an informational meeting on February 7, in San Francisco. We have shortened the workshop, from two days to one very full day, and will focus on the major issues and proposals. Attached is our suggested agenda with topics listed by their associated section in our December 2000 comprehensive Settlement Proposal. The February 7 Workshop will start at 9:00 a.m. and end around 5:00 p.m. We will be meeting at PG&E headquarters, in Conference Room 300, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco. We will not be providing lunch at this workshop due to spending restrictions. However, we hope to provide coffee and water. At this point, we also would request that all parties to reserve February 21 and 22, 2001, on their calendars, for the next workshop and feedback discussion on PG&E's December 2000 Settlement Proposal. We look forward to meeting with those of you who can attend on February 7. Also, we continue to be available at any Party's request to meet individually to go over the December Settlement Proposal in detail. Please feel free to contact either of us, and we can make the necessary arrangements.
