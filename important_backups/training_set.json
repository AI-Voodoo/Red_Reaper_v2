Now with the above information - my offered next steps : a) Until everything is done - maintain the \"stick\" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 million). It does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages. Compaq total is $5.1 million spend at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase amount of $408,000 EBS Viewpoint - c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on services of $4.1 million. To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS consulting services provided to Compaq. For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters. Compaq (Bob Jordan) value - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and hardware in 2000 EBS (added) - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million for servers and hardware in 2000 EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in 1999 EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional services (costs for Server deployment) From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the following might occur EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000 at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters) Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount is $4,134,229. We have countered with the $2.5 million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000. EBS sent Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th."

The reason why the interest is due Northern (in apparent contradiction to Northern being instructed to pay ONEOK approximately $1.2 million dollars for the retroactive correction of the meter factor error) is tied to the calculation of the accumulated interest. For example, July 1998 had a credit imbalance due NNG valued at ($753,541.27). This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for 997 days (September 1998 through June 2001) resulted in a credit interest amount due NNG of ($123,498.19). This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for only 113 days (February 2001 through June 2001) resulted in a debit interest amount due ONEOK of $14,292.01. We certainly don't mind them owing us $50,000; however, we want to see if ONEOK owes us even more than that. such that ONEOK actually owes Northern about $50,000. By summarizing these two months, we have an imbalance value that is due ONEOK of $15,866.17 with a corresponding net interest valuation due Northern of ($109,206.18)."

The more that the Master Agreement differs from the EU model contract, the less certainly an entity can have that there are adequate safeguards in place. In relation to the policy itself, this does not identify or require employees to comply in a comprehensive way with the various data protection principles under the UK Act or the Directive. In relation to section 3, this provides that Enron may expand the uses to which employee data is put as described in this policy. The above comments are based on the UK Act however it is likely that similar obligations will apply in other jurisdictions. In relation to the \"Prefatory Statement To Employee Data Protection Policy\" I note that this prefatory statement and the associated policy relate only to employee data and it is therefore unclear what steps Enron is taking in respect of other data. In relation to section 3(e), this lists again the various purposes ofprocessing employee data. In this regard, section 2 identifies the purposes ofprocessing employee data. In relation to the consent sought in section 3, this does not clearlyseek consent to international transfers of data. Although many provisions in the model contract have been paraphrased in the Master Agreement, I could not find provisions in the Master Agreement corresponding with a number of provisions in the model contract, for example: clauses 2, 3, 4(b), 5(e), 6, 7(1), 9 and 11 of the model contract, and the detailed description of the processing in Appendix 1 of the model contract. Section 2 of the policy states that Enron companies do not access sensitive data \"in making employment decisions described in (i) and (ii)\" of section 2. In the second paragraph in section 4, the policy provides that each individual who is retained by an Enron Company is responsible for ensuring that he or she takes into account the principles established by this policy. In relation to section 4, this states that \"we have not established general guidelines for the use, disclosure and retention of personal data."

Columbia Steel, Trojan Recovery, City of Burbank Contract, Bonneville Pacific). TOLI Deferred Tax Reserve - $9m PGE proposes to reverse this reserve established Q4 1999 (at the date of the Sierra Sale announcement) since the deal with Sierra was terminated, and since we now feel recording this type of reserve is more appropriate at the time of an actual transfer of the TOLI assets to Enron under any future sale of PGE. Merger MOU Obligation - PVC - $5.7m Since our new ratecase allows recovery of the remaining costs for this committment made as part of the Enron purchase of PGE, we believe the remaining liability set up in purchase accounting on PVC's books can be reversed. There are a few other items we're debating with AA&Co (in the range of $4m to 6m), and I'll let you know if any of these start to look at risk. Since the merger date, we have reversed actual costs incurred for these types of activities in the amount of $2.9 million, leaving a remaining reserve balance at 9/30/01 of $2.1 million. Pension Credit Capitalization - $5m (YTD 9/30 true-up) PGE proposes that we no longer capitalize our FAS 87 pension credit since our rates assume zero pension costs for ratemaking purposes. Major variance - TOLI loss for the month is expected to be $9.5m, or $6.5m worse than our 3rd Current Estimate. Severance Reserves - PGH1 ($2.7m) and PVC ($3.5m) At the time of the Enron purchase of PGE, severance reserves were set up for an anticipate number of involuntary terminations expected to occur within the first few years of the merger. A reserve of $5 million was established in purchase accounting for any legal/litigation and settlement costs incurred by PGC and subsidiaries to defend itself in these types of claims/proceedings."

Transwestern was able to release the 25,000 Dth/d of Ignacio to I/B Link capacity at $0.065/ Another way to calculate this amount is that ENA's portion of the capacity release revenue sharing, $1,312.50, was netted against the $15,000.00 pipeline charges for January 1-10. ENA's position is that the agreement entitled ENA to receive the revenue sharing of $1,312.50 as a cash payment during the normal billing cycle, and that the other $15,000 should be addressed during the bankruptcy claim process."

It was anticipated that the parties would execute a \"Definitive Agreement\", which would replace the Letter Agreement and contain a number of other terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon. The parties did work together for several months on negotiating an \"LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement\", which added a considerable number of important provisions and modified a number of terms and conditions contained in the Letter Agreement for the benefit of both parties. We have now drafted up the \"Definitive LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement', which we believe captures the full intent of the Letter Agreement and Term Sheet. Southern LNG, which is a party to the Quality Letter Agreement, has no intention of agreeing to meaningfully modify its Terminal, although something could be worked out if Enron were to eliminate a considerable portion of its flexibility and optionality in its sales arrangement with Merchant, an affiliate of Southern LNG. However, the Quality Letter Agreement, which is an attachment to the Letter Agreement, has become a major source of contention for two primary reasons: despite the fact that the parties did not intend to modify the Quality Letter Agreement, it is apparent to Enron, and indeed to Merchant, that this agreement does not position the Terminal with the capability of handling LNG from any meaningful number of LNG production sources in the world. Enron signed a binding Letter Agreement (which included a fairly comprehensive Term Sheet) with Merchant on October 13, 1999. This draft does represent some considerable movement from the Letter Agreement, but we found it to be acceptable with the assumption that the quality issue would be favorably resolved. As a precaution, the Letter Agreement did outline a process to bring closure to this matter in case the parties could not agree."

Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, in connection with any assignment permitted under this Section 22.2 to any assignee, the Purchaser shall have the right, from time to time by Notice to Seller and without Seller's consent, to (i) designate such assignee to be the successor of WestLB hereunder, (ii) designate such assignee to be the successor of =01&Agent=018 hereunder, (iii) designate such assignee as a sub-agent of the Agent hereunder, and (iv) designate that such assignee has succeeded to all of the rights and obligations of both WestLB and Agent, whereupon (notwithstanding the first WHEREAS clause hereof, but subject to any subsequent appointment of an =01&Agent=018 hereunder) each reference to =01&Purchaser=018 hereunder shall be deemed a reference to such assignee acting in its individual capacity and each reference to an =01&Agent=018 herein shall be deemed deleted. In determining whether Purchaser shall be permitted to assign this Agreement, Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding its consent if the proposed assignee does not have substantially the same or better credit quality than Agent unless (a) the proposed assignee provides appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or other assurances of payment issued by an entity or person with substantially the same or better credit quality than Agent, or (b) the assignor agrees to remain liable for all future liability under this Agreement. The parties further agree that the provisions of this Agreement relating to assignment will only control the assignment of Purchaser's or Agent'srights and obligations under this agreement prior to Acceptance of the Unit to be assigned. Following Acceptance, Purchaser or Agent shall be permitted, without Seller's consent, to: (i) assign its rights under this Agreement, (ii) convey any ownership interest that it may have in the Facility and/or (iii) convey any ownership interest that it may have in the entity which may own the Facility."

I wonder if we can accomplish this result with language in a later section of the Agreement regarding liability. As I understand it, the concern is that MEH should not be liable for contract damages in the event that it acts in a commercially reasonable manner, but cannot, for some reason, comply with the GTC or a Law or Judgment. The discussion at the meeting indicated that Peoples may accept use of a standard of \"commercially reasonable\" with regard to its judgment under 2.9(i) and MEH's obligation to perform in accordance with the Operating Statement, Laws and Judgments in 2.9(ii). Once Peoples obtains an order from the ICC which both parties accept, Peoples should be willing to assume the risk (which,in my opinion is minimal) that an adverse rate decision would cause it to wish to terminate the Agency Agreement. I believe Peoples wishes to revise (1) to read: \" permitted by the terms of the GT&C, or required by any Law and Judment:. Peoples agreed at the meeting that there should be compensation after termination of the Agreement for an extended Hub Service presented during the Agreement's term. Peoples proposes to delete our proposed Section 3.5 which requires Peoples to use its best efforts to minimize imbalances experienced by Hub Shippers through use of management services offered under pipeline tariffs. 11.1 (vi) and (vii) of the LLC Agreement) which grants a termination right, \"in the event that a Jugment determines that, as a result of Hub Transactions, Peoples is subject to comprehensive rate regulation as a natural gas company or public utility by the FERC; or loses its status as an exempt Hinshaw pipeline under Section 1(c) of the Natural Gas Act.\" The Agreement (6.1) presently provides that Peoples, in its sole discretion, may propose changes in the GTC. Peoples only concern in proposing deletion was that the LLC Agreement might be requested by the ICC Staff due to the reference. Also, in Section 15.4, I believe the reference to Sect. The deleted wording of 7.2 should be restored, and to that Section we could add a sentence: \"The right to compensation established under Section 7.2 (ii) for an Extended Hub Service shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\" As proposed in our draft, either party would have a termination right in the event that the Agency Agreement is not initially approved by the ICC on acceptable terms. 3.3 to read: \"Peoples will pay to MEH all funds necessary to effect such refunds on or before the earlier of : (i) the date prescribed by a Law or Judgment for payment of such refunds; or (ii) ten (10) business days after receiving written notice of the need for such payment.\" As I understand it, the description of the services both for the Agreement and the GTC may be changed to replace the existing references to transportation services a reference to \"wheeling\" serivces. Also, Peoples agreed that Section 5.1 should include a representation that Peoples has provided MEH with a current copy of the presently effective GT&C. 12. (Note: In the Northern Illinois Gas Hub Agreement, the utility agreed to the provision we proposed.) Peoples agreed at the meeting that Section 5.1 could be revised to eliminate the refernce to Laws and Judgments with a materially adverse effect. This means that the administrative fee could be adjusted retroactively only if a transaction occurs under a newly proposed rate which is part of the Operating Statement, but subject to refund at a level higher than the previously approved rate but lower than the maximum price under the new rate. To make this clear,the words \"during the term of this Agreement\" should be deleted from Sect. Based on discussion at the meeting, I understand that there is a need to address the \"two county rule\" in the Agreement. Peoples agrees that there should be a representation that the Agreement does n ot violate \"any Judgment or Law applicable to it\",as originally proposed. 15. Section 5.1."

Section 17.3(a) should be revised to read as follows: \"promptly refund the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the Purchase Amount) and pay Cover Damages plus Termination Costs described in Sections 17.4.2(i) and 17.4.2(iv) described below; or\" 2. The third and fourth sentences of Section 17.4.1 should be revised to read as follows: \"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value, the difference between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the \"Refund Amount\") shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4 below. It is InterGen's understanding that the Purchase Amount is currently $1,829,000, subject to adjustment by future change orders, and that the amounts previously paid plus the Purchase Amount are equal to the Maximum Liability Amount of $14,352,000, subject to adjustment by future change orders.

A draft of this Transfer Agreement has been previously reviewed by Mark Metts. The Transfer Agreement provides no party may have a change in control of their ownership in the project without the consent of the other parties. When the Gaza project was being conceived, the former CALME management agreed to the Transfer Agreement and this agreement was memorialized in detail in the Joint Venture Agreement among the parties. The Gaza team has spent a great deal of time over the past six months trying to either soften the nature of the Transfer Agreement or to make the restriction apply to some entity lower in the ownership chain than Enron Corp. Therefore, it appears that we must deal with the Transfer Agreement now in order to allow Enron to preserve its tax deferral position, transfer the IPO funds and ultimately allow the project to meet its debt service obligations to the bank on January 3rd. These efforts have been unsuccessful as the partners claim that the Transfer Agreement was a \"pillar\" of the deal that we had and furthermore that this deal had been agreed directly with very senior Enron personnel."

We've revised Section 3 \"Your Signature and Notices\" and the Representations and Warranties section under the GT&Cs to model the ME Rules by deleting references to \"Your Rights as a Customer Statement\" (a document unique toTexas) and changed references to \"electricity facts label\" to \"disclosure label\" (ME's description of the label, as opposed to TX's). Terms of Service As discussed, the Maine Rules were modeled after the Massachusetts Rules and many items, such as the terms of service summary and disclosure label, are practically identical in format and content. Customer Authorization Statement The Rules regarding the content of the customer authorization statement areidentical to the MA Rules and, as such, we have modeled the ME form after MA. * We've left the requirement of concurrent execution of the customer authorization form in Section 2.1(i) and Section 3 unchanged although the Rules only require that this document be obtained prior to initiating service ."

Payments due to the NYISO for December 1999 settlement adjustments are due to be received in the NYISO clearing account on Monday, October 15, 2001. Customers may validate their respective adjustments by computing their ratio shares of the $581,563.37 using 5,059,790 MWh as the denominator in their respective ratios of their December 1999 load. December 1999 settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to address the delay in invoicing. In October 2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred. Customers where allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for the month. Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly. This is due to the fact that the costs for adjustment #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment. The total adjustment of $581,563.37 was allocated across 13,147,961 MWh. Transmission Customers will observe adjustments to their settlements to: (1) recover costs related to adjustments made outside of the billing process; (2) adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and (3) adjust the NYISO clearing account balance to zero for December 1999 settlements. Regards, Randy A. Bowers Manager - Customer Settlements (See attached file: December_1999_2nd_Settlement Adjustment_Invoice_Banking_Instructions.PDF) - December_1999_2nd_Settlement Adjustment_Invoice_Banking_Instructions. This billing treatment for the December 1999 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market totaling $5,219,402.09 allocated across 13,191,237 MWh.  BROGERS (Non-Privileged).pst The invoices for December 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by 23:00 today, Friday, September 28, 2001. Customers will observe a difference in the denominators used in the ratio share allocation of this adjustment versus adjustment #3."

In addition to the comments/questions noted within the Confirmation itself, I have the following thoughts/questions: 1) Note that the Enron Corp Guaranty is currently limited to an aggregate amount of $30,000,000 (this may become an issue late in the day when the folks over at Merrill figure out that this is one of the disadvantages to using a confirm as opposed to doing a sep. transaction with a separate and distinct Enron Corp. Guaranty); 2) Per Section 1.1 of the Master, in the event of any conflicts between the Master and a Confirm for a particular transaction, the Confirm governs; 3) Section 1.4 of the Master Agreement makes reference to a \"Qualified Financial Contract\" - is that applicable to this Transaction? Section 8.1(ii) currently reads: Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion; provided, however, either Party may, without the consent of (but with notice to) the other Party (and without relieving itself from liability hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement and all Transactions hereunder as a whole or the accounts, revenues or proceeds hereof as a whole in connection with any financing or other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party; provided, that such Party's Credit Support Provider issues a Credit Support Document substantially in the form provided in connection with the execution hereof,; 8) The draft of the Confirmation does not make reference to any of the 3 \"Facilities\".

Comments on the PG&E Form of Master Pursuant to your meeting at our office yesterday, Peter Keohane asked me to provide you with a brief list of key issues/amendments relating to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company form of Master Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (the \"Master\").

This Agreement, all Transactions under this Agreement, and any guarantee thereof as applicable, each and together constitute an \"eligible financial contract\" under and in all proceedings related to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada), the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) or the Winding-up and Restructuring Act (Canada), as the same may be amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted from time to time, and will be treated similarly under and in all proceedings related to any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law (regardless of the jurisdiction of application or competence of such law) or any ruling, order, directive or pronouncement made pursuant thereto.\" If the Delivery Point is NIT, this Article 11.2 shall apply. Neither Party shall transfer or assign this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party, which approval may be withheld or given entirely at the option of such Party; provided, however, either Party may transfer or assign its interest hereunder to an affiliate, subsidiary or to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets of such Party, all without the prior written approval of the other Party, but no such assignment will relieve the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder.\" Miscellaneous: s.17.8 As a material inducement to entering into this Agreement, including each Transaction, each Party, with respect to itself, hereby represents and warrants to the other Party, continuing throughout the term of this Agreement and on the date that each Transaction is entered into, as follows: (a) there are no suits, proceedings, judgments or orders by or before any court or any governmental authority that materially adversely affect its ability to perform this Agreement or the rights of the other Party under this Agreement; (b) it is duly organized and validly existing, and it has the legal right, power, authority and qualifications, and has obtained all necessary consents and regulatory authorizations, for it to conduct its business, to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and under each Transaction; (c) (i) each Transaction shall constitute a \"commodity contract\" or an \"OTC derivative\" or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securities legislation in force in Alberta and British Columbia and pursuant to the securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction, and (ii) it is a \"Qualified Party\" within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR 91-501, in any such case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted from time to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia and any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction; (d) the making and performance of this Agreement are within its powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary action and do not and will not violate any provision of law or any rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, decree or other determination presently in effect applicable to it or any provision of its governing documents; and (e) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and binding act and obligation of it, enforceable against it, in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and with regard to any equitable remedies, to the discretion of the court before which proceedings to obtain such remedies may be pending.

To:Sanders, Richard B. Cc:Annmarie Robertson Subject:Billings My accounting department advises me that back on April 27,2001, Enron apparently sent us a check for $54,585.11, which we received and deposited on May 7. The check included the payment of $28,087.71 for this firm (the exact amount of our February billing) and mistakenly included payment of $26,497.40 for one of Ed Kee's (PA Consulting Group) bills. We can and will obviously do that , but then we have to immediately ask Enron for that same amount-$26,497.40- because our prior bills would have been underpaid by that same amount. My accounting department says it would be easier to just send out the July billing with a cover letter confirming that the $26,497.40 erroneously paid to us on May 7 has been credited in full to Enron, and is fully reflected in the total balance due."

Note that this same change applies in the Agreement in Principle related to the purchase of turbines. Roger suggested I delete the limit on ENA's liability in Article 10 to remove the implication it had any, which I did ( and which means we have no upside protection if we are construed to have obligations under the XTIA. This alternate revision to the XTIA takes a minimalist approach, and incorporates only the new business terms, some minor clean up/clarifications, and the AA change to Section 2.2 and the change to Article 10 ( to remove a cap for ENA's laibility) suggested by Roger. We could provide in the agreements that GE makes this payment directly to CCSI or we can continue to have the right to receive the payment from GE under the XTIA and the obligation to pay it to CCSI under the Repurchase Agreement. The principal change suggested by AA - the deletion of the last sentence of the BOLD language in Section 2.2 - removed the obligation for ENA to pick up any obligations under the agreement owed by West LB in excess of the \"Cap\". I attempted this by increasing the limit on West LB's liability in Article 10 to $20 million from $9.9 million so that GE's recourse against West LB is the same as it had against West LB and ENA in the prior drafts, and by obligating West LB, in the default provisions, to pony up for an ENA default."

CCSI will have notice of any such event ( see Section 3.2 (h) of the Option Repurchase Agreement) and ENA will have no incentive to cause West LB to advance funds if GE is not performing. Article 5 was modified to incorporate the Operative Agreements so we have consistent assignment terms. Remember that Annexes A and B to Exhibit A are in a separate document because of format and need to be inserted in behind Exhibit A and before Annex C. Section 1.1 of the Agreement was revised to clarify that the Paid Premium amount payable by ENA was such amount at the Option Repurchase Date, to correct a date reference to the date the Milestone 4 Refund Amount becomes payable by GE, to clarify that the vested value of the Xonon Credits equal to the Paid Premium applies in the assignment of credits to ENA pursuant to Section 1.2, and to clarify that ENA may withhold from the Milestone 4 Refund Amount payable to CCSI any unpaid premium plus any other amounts owed by CCSI to ENA ( eg, legal expenses incurred by ENA in seeking to collect Unpaid Premium). Section 2.2 was revised to add a new defined term \"Operative Agreements\" to refer to the Exhibits and Annexes to the Agreement and the notion of Operative Agreements was worked into Section 2.2 to make it clear that ENA was released from its obligations under the Confirmantion and Guaranty ( if any, since it is a party) when released from the Agreement. Option Repurchase Agreement. The Confirmation also eliminates references to a Master Agreement signed in the future to supplement the terms of the option ( could be disruptive to say the least) and CCSI's right to object to the terms of the confirm ( unnecessary in this closely negotiated transaction). Since the confidentiality agreement was never signed, Section 10.8 has been supplemented to include some of the key concepts from the proposed confidentiality agreement, including CCSI's requested modification that disclosure not be made to any person without consent unless the person had agreed to confidentiality restrictions as least as stringent as those in Section 10.8. The changes to the Guaranty and Indemnification Agreement are intended to clarify that ENA is not required to make demand under the Guaranty before proceeding to collect under the letter of credit, and to clarify that the condition to payment is CCSI's failure to pay upon a Joint Concurrence. Section 2.2 also makes clear that ENA cannot assign rights under Section 7.2 of the Xonon Agreement to CCSI ( consistent with the limitations on ENA's rights in Section 4.5 of the Xonon Agreement). Article 7 indemnification now applies for Catalytica's default under the guaranty.  sshackle.nsf Attached please find the latest versions of the above-referenced documents, marked to show changes from the versions distributed 12/9, except in the case of Annexes C ( Guaranty and Indemnification Agreement) and D ( form of the drawing certificate to the CCSI letter of credit, the complete letter to be supplied by CCSI on Monday) to Exhibit A to the Option Repurchase Agreement. I incorporated the Guaranty and Indemnification Agreement and form of drawing certificate as received from CCSI counsel on Friday night into version 7f in order that our revisions to these documents would be reflected in these marked versions. Article 4 was revised to clarify that the 30 day cure period did not apply to failures to pay the Premium Payment installments and to add nonpayment under the Guaranty or failure by the bank to advance funds under the Letter of Credit upon presentation of a proper drawing certificate as Events of Default outside the cure period. Section 11.2 was modified to add a reference to Article 10 ( to make clear the survival of pending claims at 12/31/06 provision in that Article was not in conflict with Section 11.2). Section 9.2 (b) was revised to delete an incorrect reference to Texas law in arbitration ( more consistent with fact that New York law applies to the agreement) and the insert in (iii) was made to reflect that selection of arbitrators is dealt with in (a) and should not be overriden by any supplemental procedures of the AAA. Article 9 was modified to make clear all the Operative Agreements must be in place for the Option Repurchase Agreement to become effective, and Article 10 incorporates the Operative Agreements so that we have consistent terms for the miscellaneous provisions. This is consistent with the understanding that the Paid Premium will mirror in amount and be paid at least concurrently with the West LB advances under the Xonon Agreement. Article 3 was amended to incorporate the Operative Agreements into the representations and warranties of the parties."

(iii) Sole Paragraph of Clause 2 - We deem it convenient to explain that in addition to the penalty set forth, Enron shall be liable for all the costs related to the removal of the cables and equipments that may have being attached in the infrastructure during the 120 days period; (iv) Paragraph 4 of Clause 3 - All PAC drafts establish that payment will be due within 5 days counted from the presentation of relevant invoice. (ii) Paragraph 7 of Clause 1 - As we see it, this clause would allow Enron to negotiate the use of its cables among the agents. We included this clause in all PAC drafts based on the principle set forth in article 12 of the Resolution. With regard to ANEEL approval, the advice we have received is that approval under the Joint Resolution is not needed (since the Joint Resolution does not apply). The changes have been made on the basis that the Enron company which enters into the contract will not be the holder of an ANATEL licence and most of the suggested changes reflect the fact that the Joint Resolution will therefore not apply. Be as it may, our suggestion is to have this clause re-drafted (and also Clause 11) so as to establish that Enron may sublease or sell any or all fibers to third parties as long as Enron's remain liable before Elektro for all the obligations assumed under the PAC. Please find below our comments on the proposed changes: (i) Clause 1 and Paragraph 2 - As establish under item ix of article 20 of Joint Resolution 01/99 (Resolution), Elektro shall have the right to forbid any sublease of the infrastructure or use of same for purposes other than those provided for in the Pole Attachment Contract (PAC) without Elektro's prior consent."

I suggest that, in the Master, you similarly strike out the word \"other\" and insert after \"obligations\" the words \"(other than those pursuant to Section 5.3)\".

HB 1148 CKL <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)> Stan also feels that if HB 1492 becomes law then the State of Texas could force us (Enron) to go beyond the Federal Regulations (47 C. F. R.

Section 14 has been substantially revised, but is still confusing, However, the idea is that the agreement include a single provision governing confidentiality and that certain information that Enron is particularly sensitive about will be kept confidential, while other information becomes eSpeed's property at some point to do with as it wishes. Also, Section 4(d) includes a right by Enron to suspend prices specifically in the event of mapping errors; this provision also relates to the termination right in Section 13 with respect to mapping errors. 6. Section 5(b) has been revised to reflect that the parties should develop a set of ground rules for operating and maintaining the Interfaces that will govern the parties once they commence operations.

This document is not and does not create a lien, but rather just sets up the statutory requirements for a lien to be file in case MFN does not pay. My assumption in preparing the License Agreement was that there would be a business contract between Enron Networks and MFN covering such its as pricing, specific services, payment obligations and a prohibition against placing liens on the property. Fisk has sent us a notice of lien claiming non-payment from MFN in the amount of $83,210.00."

However, ifwe have not yet entered into an EOL Agreement with a counterparty, we can address all EOL issues in the Confirmation Agreement itself and thus obviate the need for two separate agreements. We would need to update the Confirmation Agreements as changes to the product terms occur. II.Additional Terms and Conditions of Confirmation Attached below please find the Form of Agreement Relating to Power Transactions Confirmed by ConfirmLogic (the \"Confirmation Agreement\"). Moreover, as we negotiate new master agreements with such counterparties, we must be aware of the terms of the Confirmation Agreement and address whether to conform the new master to the Confirmation Agreement or incorporate the terms of the Confirmation Agreement into the new master and thus supersede the Confirmation Agreement. The CommodityLogic website contains private and public folders that may be utilized by Enron to post the Confirmation Agreement electronically. If we have already entered into an EOL Agreement with a counterparty,we need not address EOL trades in the Confirmation Agreement."

Concerning Annex 3:- I concur with your observations that in many lending and repo master agreements there are events of default that are of another nature than the events which are Events of Default under the ISDA. I attach the alternative proposal for Annex 3.

Following meetings of the Strategic Documentation Review Task Force in late July and discussions in August and September, it was felt that the Protocol approach was too complicated, from an operational and logistical perspective, given the nature and the number of the proposed amendments. Annexes 1 to 9 of the Protocol have been prepared as a Form of Amendment to the ISDA Master Agreements. The 2001 Euro Protocol is now available on our website and the adherence period ends on November 30, 2001. Accordingly, it was decided that the four euro annexes would be separated from the Protocol and compiled in their own 2001 Euro Protocol. As many of you know, various working groups prepared amendments to the ISDA Master Agreements to be effected through the use of a 2001 ISDA Master Agreement Protocol."

November 1999 settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to address the delay in invoicing. Payments due to market participants will be made on Thursday, September 27, 2001. Payments due to the NYISO for November 1999 settlement adjustments are due to be received in the NYISO clearing account on Monday, September 24, 2001. Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly. Customers will observe a difference in the denominators used in the ratio share allocation of this adjustment versus adjustment #2. The NYISO anticipates that the 2nd settlement adjustment for December 1999 settlements will be invoiced tomorrow, Tuesday, September 2001 by 23:00. In order to allow any changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market. Customers where allocated their portion of this adjustment based upon their respective ratio shares of the 5,074,229 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for the month. Given the aforementioned schedules, payments due to the NYISO for December 1999 settlement adjustments will be due to be received in the NYISO clearing account on Tuesday, September 25, 2001. This billing treatment for the November 1999 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market totaling $5,583,559.78 allocated across 5,074,229 MWh. In October 2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred. This is due to the fact that the costs for adjustment #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment. Regards, Randy A. Bowers Manager - Customer Settlements (See attached file: November_1999_2nd_Settlement Adjustment_Invoice_Banking_Instructions.PDF) - November_1999_2nd_Settlement Adjustment_Invoice_Banking_Instructions."

In Section 2.1(a), there is a reference to Accenture's right to sublicense. There is a reference in Section 2.2 to \"updates and revisions.\" Section 2.5 also contains a reference to \"co-branding marketing\" activities, and requires Enron to support and assist Accenture. In Section 2.2, the same comments in points 5 apply to the exclusive license of the software. If so, what is the effect of the exclusive right in Section 2.5? In Section 2.1(a), the scope of the \"exclusive\" license needs to be carefully thought through and narrowed as much as possible. The exception in Section 2.5 to Enron's provision of the data services is very troubling, as it would appear that Accenture is trying to limit Enron's discretion in establishing its own pricing. The \"worldwide license\" provisions of Section 9.1 require some discussion. Section 2.5 is yet another twist on exclusivity.  andy zipper 6-26-02.PST Travis: Here are my general comments on the May 1st draft of the TSH License Agreement between Enron and Accenture.
